Moreover, according to the same source, some of these chips include the latest 7nm model, with a single power of 50 Tera hashes per second. The recent Bitmain order also comprises 16nm model chips. Therefore, within a few months, observers believe that Bitmain’s total network computing power could skyrocket by about 50%.

The veteran technologist, who chose EOS to run his decentralized content distribution platform Everipedia, threatened to fire the blockchain project. He criticized EOS for becoming a de facto centralized ledger controlled entirely by the Chinese entities. Stating that Everipedia couldn’t function atop a heavily centralized blockchain, Sanger said the dapp would eventually quit EOS. Excerpts: The statements appeared twenty months after Sanger announced they would develop a “truly censorship-proof system” on the top of EOS blockchain. As Everipedia’s chief information officer, Sanger noted that EOS would make the process of approving articles, making edits and storing information more distributed. His latest comments merely highlighted that the project did not assist Everipedia in becoming an authentic, decentralized version of Wikipedia. Despite becoming one of the most remarkable public blockchains, EOS has a problem concerning its integrity. There are only a few people who own a vast a majority of the project’s tokens. That gives them an oversized influence on the right to select block producers, a total of 21 entities that validate and add transaction records on the native blockchain. The structure reminds one of a corrupted democratic process, wherein one individual can vote 100 times because he has 100 different identity cards (tokens). That increases the probability of potential cooperation, where malicious actors can join together to seize the EOS funds or alter transaction records on the blockchain. Nevertheless, the real trouble lies in the inability of Block.One, the parent company of the #8 cryptocurrency, to solve the problem. That became worse when Dan Larimar, the CTO of Block.One, confirmed that decentralization is not their topmost priority.  Blockchain rating agency Weiss Crypto Ratings downgraded EOS score after recognizing the issues in their voting mechanism, with researcher Juan Villaverde saying: “EOS developers have seen the flaw in their voting scheme. But they have not offered a viable solution. To us, this amounts to an admission of defeat.” What do you think about Larry Sanger’s comments regarding EOS? Add your thoughts below.

That was the conclusion from Arianna Simpson, founder and CEO of crypto and blockchain-focused investment fund Autonomous Partners. In a discussion on social media August 22, Simpson said sentiment favored Bitcoin over altcoins now, but that status quo has changed multiple times and could do so again. “The general crypto narrative seems to be drifting back to bitcoin maximalism,” she summarized. …BTC has clearly outperformed most other cryptoassets by a wide margin YTD. Expecting that this will always be the case (or that holding only BTC is the right move) strikes me as foolish. The comments come at a timely juncture in cryptocurrency’s history. As Bitcoinist reported, Bitcoin’s returns have vastly outperformed major altcoins in 2019. Unlike the previous bull run in 2017, alts have so far failed to rally, losing more and more value in BTC terms.  Top five tokens such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) continue to trade around 80% below their all-time highs. Against BTC, both are lower than ever. Well-known traders have thus gone on record in recent weeks to announce the death of the altcoin market, possibly for good. Among them was Peter Brandt, who likened the lifelessness of alt markets to the dot com boom of the early 2000s. Simpson’s opposing argument is thus even more conspicuous. “Those who have been in this space for many years should recall that this is by no means the first time the pendulum has swung back and forth — in 2017 bitcoin was old news and it was all the shiny new (Layer 1 technologies) that were going to take over the world,” she continued. “In reality, ETH was a better performing investment for many (even when considering the major correction of 2018!) than BTC was. So BTC remains king, but discounting everything else is silly.” Her remarks will be music to the ears of long-suffering investors whose portfolios have failed to react to this year’s Bitcoin bull market.  Pressure also continues to come from Bitcoin advocates, with developer Udi Wertheimer this week publicly chastising Ethereum participants in particular for the losses following 2017’s ICO craze.  “It’s time for the ETH gang to wake up, smell the ashes, and take some responsibility,” he tweeted.  “Their 2017 ‘blockchain everything’ narrative failed miserably and cost retail investors BILLIONS, dumped into scams supported by ETH naiveté.” What do you think about the Bitcoin vs. altcoins debate?

According to a social media exchange on August 23, the embattled cryptocurrency payment processor is facing fresh criticism after it failed to allow a $100,000 Bitcoin 00 donation to go through. The payment came from a donor to the Amazon Watch charity, which uses BitPay to accept cryptocurrency payments.  BitPay reportedly rejected the payment because Amazon Watch’s maximum permitted amount was lower than $100,000. After ignoring a formal complaint, BitPay staff told the charity on Twitter it could resolve the issue itself by changing the settings in its account. This turned out to be untrue, however, as in order to allow a higher level, the company must first submit compliance documentation. “…We tried to increase the volume but can’t do it through the dashboard and were told we needed to email compliance,” it confirmed.  The debacle adds further fuel to the criticism which frequently engulfs BitPay. Overzealous bureaucracy, compounded by a separate scandal about fake transaction fees, have led to frequent calls for businesses to use open source alternative payment processors. The logic, as one Twitter user pointed out in comments on Amazon Watch’s difficulties, is that Bitcoin is a free and open payment system. Third parties vetting transactions arbitrarily contradicts its sole purpose. “…You don’t need (BitPay) to reject your transactions when you can verify them yourselves for free,” the response reads. BitPay’s PR difficulties have a long history. As far back as 2017, executives opted to support the controversial SegWit2x Bitcoin scaling proposal, which led to hardware wallet Trezor publicly ditching the company. Amazon Watch said it would look into using BTCPay, an alternative open source option, in a move which would copy that of travel agent CheapAir last year. A backlash over BitPay’s previous actions meanwhile had led to many wallet providers freezing out support for its invoices. Unless they use a handful of wallets, Bitcoin holders find themselves unable to send transactions to BitPay addresses.  The company has curiously sought to make it as hard as possible to extract Bitcoin addresses from invoices. Doing so requires technical knowledge far beyond the scope of the average user. BitPay says the setup is in order to mitigate risk from bad actors, and advises clients to use its own wallet instead.

There is clearly a mass of buyers waiting in the upper $9,000 price zone to keep the digital asset from falling further. Yesterday, analysts were leaning towards a bearish stance predicting further declines, even into the $8k region. The lowest price tapped by BTC was $9,750 according to Tradingview.com. During today’s Asian trading session it returned to $10,250 and has started to consolidate around there, currently trading at 00.

Yesterday the bitcoin fear and greed index dropped to its lowest level for over a year hitting 5, today it is back up to 33.

Some may see this as a greater risk/reward opportunity but popular crypto analyst Josh Rager remains bearish. $ETH will surely increase in value but has been outperformed by $BTC ever since the ICO boom busted.

Indeed, in varying degrees, top democratic presidential contenders have already referred to Bitcoin and its technology.  Among the democratic candidates, Andrew Yang has taken the most innovative stance on issues since announcing his run for president. He has not avoided discussing cryptocurrency-related topics. Most recently, during an interview on The Coin Chat show, Yang declared, “My vision of the economy is very consistent with the people who are in the cryptocurrency community.” Thus, his comprehensive set of policy proposals includes one entitled “Crypto/Digital Asset Regulation and Consumer Protection.” Yang’s campaign recognizes that the crypto industry has great potential, but it has outpaced the U.S. control framework. In this regard, his campaign website declares, Investment in cryptocurrencies and digital assets has far outpaced our regulatory frameworks in the US. We should let investors, companies, and individuals know that the landscape and treatment will be moving forward to support innovation and development. The blockchain has vast potential. As a testimony to Yang’s pro-technology stance, innovative investors and technology CEOs are helping to fund his campaign. The Tech 1,000 is a list of such campaign contributors, including • Jack Dorsey, Square/Twitter • Sam Altman, YCombinator • Miles Lasater, F-Prime Capital Partners • Patrick Comer, Lucid • Mike Gamson, LinkedIn Another key innovator supporting Yang is Elon Musk. On August 10, 2019, Musk published a Tweet announcing his support for Yang. Joe Biden, as of this writing, leads the democratic field. Biden also has Bitcoin-friendly supporters in his camp. So far, however, Biden has not explicitly mentioned the cryptocurrency. However, during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Draft Biden Super PAC expressed its willingness to receive bitcoins to fund his eventual campaign. As The Hill reported at that time, Draft Biden director Joseph Schweitzer, announced, Ready your mobile wallet and you’ll be able to simply scan-and-donate. There’s no hassle with a card number, no delay and unparalleled cryptographic security. Elizabeth Warren, one of Biden’s closest contenders, has weighed in on issues affecting the crypto industry. According to her, crypto assets are easy to steal, and scammers take advantage of investors through ICOs. However, according to Forbes, Warren stated, “The challenge is how to nurture productive aspects of crypto with protecting consumers.” On the other side of the political spectrum, Donald Trump has already declared his stance against Bitcoin. However, his former political strategist Stephen Bannon has predicted that Bitcoin and other crypto assets will disrupt the banking system. And, according to The New York Times, Bannon advises entrepreneurs and countries to issue their own cryptocurrencies. So far, the topic of Bitcoin has not been mentioned in the debates. Bitcoin enthusiasts will most likely keep an eye on the 10 democratic candidates in the next debate, which is scheduled for 12 and 13 September 2019.

Even with a correction of around 30% the digital asset is still up over 160% this year. That growth could have been spurred by central banks devaluing their own currencies as economic skies darken. Demand and fervor for bitcoin is most prevalent in Asia. Trading on markets during the Asian time zone has dictated the mood for the rest of the day elsewhere on countless occasions. China is one of the leading players in the BTC trading arena despite ongoing efforts from Beijing to crush it and control the flow of finances from its burgeoning population. According to reports, the volume of purchases of bitcoin and other crypto assets in China has surged by 50% during the current quarter. The report added that buying demand increased on the day the People’s Bank of China confirmed that it will adopt its own digital currency. Other catalysts that have driven the Chinese towards bitcoin also include the devaluation of the Yuan. The government is clearly concerned about capital outflow and has already introduced measures to stem it by capping the amount that can be taken out of China. The PBoC clearly views cryptocurrency as a threat to its own domination over finances, and the people are waking up to this fact. A chief Asia economist for one major international bank said; Only a central bank is allowed to issue base money. They are defending their own monopoly. Japan, which is nowhere near as autocratic as China, has a completely different outlook on digital assets. A senior official at the Bank of Japan told the Nikkei Asian Review: Because of their fear of capital outflows, the Chinese see every financial asset as the enemy. But we don’t worry about outflows. We are in love with the technology behind it and we are in touch with the technology community. We promote bitcoin but only with controls, Japan’s regulatory body already monitors crypto trading patterns but is more concerned with money laundering than people hedging on different currencies. Central banks are clearly contributing to bitcoin demand by deflating their respective currencies in order to stimulate their economies. Escalating trade wars only exacerbate these issues as their promotion of protectionist policies stifles growth everywhere. US president Donald Trump has publically threatened to devalue the dollar in response to efforts by the Chinese to undermine his trade tariffs. Earlier this month, it was widely reported that Chinese investors were stocking up on BTC as their currency dropped to a seven year low against the USD. Both the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve have taken deflationary measures and they are unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future. This has all been good news for bitcoin which has increased in value as demand is driven by central banks in developed markets. Are central banks having an impact on bitcoin demand?

One of the most prolific and respected Core-developers, Wuille is responsible for the creation and implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit).  Miniscript is built on top of the existing Script language for Bitcoin smart contracts and aims to optimise it. Script allows the specification of certain conditions which must be met in order for bitcoin to be spent. This could be a time-limit, before which coins are locked in, or the requirement of multiple signatures to verify a transaction. However, Script becomes unwieldy when required to perform various kinds of static analysis, generic signing, and compilation of policies. According to Wuille’s documentation, Miniscript functions are a representation for scripts that makes these sort of operations possible. Wuille tweeted an example of how policies can be combined: Imagine a company wants to protect its cold storage funds using a 2-of-3 multisig policy with 3 executives. One of the executives however has a nice 2FA/multisig/timelock based setup on his own. Why can’t that entire setup be one of the multisig “participants”? With Miniscript, the executive’s two factor authentication (2FA) could seamlessly work with the cold storage requirements. A script could compute the composite sig required and still be able to sign as a participant in the multisig. Wuille stated that he would work into incorporating parts of Miniscript into Bitcoin core if there is a desire for this amongst developers. However as published, it has already undergone extensive testing against actual Bitcoin consensus rules. Wuille says that ideally, it would be included run many pieces of wallet technology, and his co-developers have been working on a Rust library for it. Wuille is a high-profile figure in the Bitcoin community, and earlier this year participated in the Lightning Torch relay. What do you think of the new optimized smart contract language?

The BTC/USD instrument settled a session low of $9,841.59 at around 16:05 UTC today, establish its five-day low. The pair moved downwards despite having full-backing of strong fundamentals. Late last week, Intercontinental Exchange’s cryptocurrency arm, Bakkt, announced that it had received regulatory approval to launch its bitcoin futures contracts. The platform even finalized the launch-date on September 23, raising hopes of attracting institutional capital to the bitcoin markets. The benchmark cryptocurrency dropped nevertheless, signifying that investors did not fully digest an otherwise bullish Bakkt announcement. That left the market with a handful of interconnected reasons that attempted to explain bitcoin’s downside sentiment. Here are three of them. A global slowdown kept investors’ purchasing sentiment at bay. A majority of them waited for the annual meeting of global central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, expecting a wave of new stimulus programs to address the recession concerns. Bitcoin appeared as a less-attractive asset for investors who were looking to park their capital in low-risk safe-havens. That explains a surge in demand for US Treasuries, which registered their best month since 2015. It appears the early week rise in the bitcoin market did not come from the outside by from the underperforming, neighboring cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, many analysts believe that monetary easing policies would help bring more money to bitcoin, for investors would be able to borrow at lower interest rates. “Bitcoin’s becoming increasingly a macro hedge for investors against things that could go wrong,” said Thomas Lee, co-founder of Fundstrats Global Advisors. “Rate cuts are adding liquidity. Liquidity is pushing money into all these risk assets and also hedges, which is helping Bitcoin.” Rising Wedge are bearish patterns, characterized by price trending upwards inside a contracting range. The technical indicator typically sends the asset’s rate lower once it reaches the apex of the Wedge. Bitcoin, for all the past few days, was trending inside a Rising Wedge, as shown in the chart below. Bitcoin breaks down from a rising wedge pattern | Image Credits: TradingView.com The bitcoin price today broke down from the same design, confirming its bias. It explains that the reason for the fall could have been merely technical, and has nothing to do with the cryptocurrency’s longer-term bias. The BTC/USD pair now expects to bounce back from the $9,651 area. Arguable yet highly likely, the latest bitcoin price drop could have been driven by whales – a slang for investors holding a larger quantity of bitcoins. The early week saw the cryptocurrency rising by more than $800, or circa 8.5 percent, in the wake of Bakkt announcement. It appears that big traders led the price rally, and drove small investors in the ride to the upside. Nevertheless, they exited their long positions right upon entering their target price area. In the entire process, no outside money entered the bitcoin market. These are some of the possible reasons behind the bitcoin price drop. Have something to add? Then do share in the comment below.

That was the conclusion from Arianna Simpson, founder and CEO of crypto and blockchain-focused investment fund Autonomous Partners. In a discussion on social media August 22, Simpson said sentiment favored Bitcoin over altcoins now, but that status quo has changed multiple times and could do so again. “The general crypto narrative seems to be drifting back to bitcoin maximalism,” she summarized. …BTC has clearly outperformed most other cryptoassets by a wide margin YTD. Expecting that this will always be the case (or that holding only BTC is the right move) strikes me as foolish. The comments come at a timely juncture in cryptocurrency’s history. As Bitcoinist reported, Bitcoin’s returns have vastly outperformed major altcoins in 2019. Unlike the previous bull run in 2017, alts have so far failed to rally, losing more and more value in BTC terms.  Top five tokens such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) continue to trade around 80% below their all-time highs. Against BTC, both are lower than ever. Well-known traders have thus gone on record in recent weeks to announce the death of the altcoin market, possibly for good. Among them was Peter Brandt, who likened the lifelessness of alt markets to the dot com boom of the early 2000s. Simpson’s opposing argument is thus even more conspicuous. “Those who have been in this space for many years should recall that this is by no means the first time the pendulum has swung back and forth — in 2017 bitcoin was old news and it was all the shiny new (Layer 1 technologies) that were going to take over the world,” she continued. “In reality, ETH was a better performing investment for many (even when considering the major correction of 2018!) than BTC was. So BTC remains king, but discounting everything else is silly.” Her remarks will be music to the ears of long-suffering investors whose portfolios have failed to react to this year’s Bitcoin bull market.  Pressure also continues to come from Bitcoin advocates, with developer Udi Wertheimer this week publicly chastising Ethereum participants in particular for the losses following 2017’s ICO craze.  “It’s time for the ETH gang to wake up, smell the ashes, and take some responsibility,” he tweeted.  “Their 2017 ‘blockchain everything’ narrative failed miserably and cost retail investors BILLIONS, dumped into scams supported by ETH naiveté.” What do you think about the Bitcoin vs. altcoins debate?

Unsurprisingly, Anthony Pompliano is not worried. Next week, the G7 is scheduled and this time the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States will set aside some time to discuss Bitcoin and digital currencies at length.  Previously, the group had discussed the need for oversight and regulation within the nascent sector, but the final result amounted to each country developing their own regulatory frameworks or doing nothing at all.  Earlier this week, Morgan Creek Digital Asset CEO Anthony Pompliano briefly spoke to CNBC’s Joe Kernen about Bitcoin’s upcoming second ‘debut’ before the G7.   The digital asset analyst focused on the fact that in just 10 years Bitcoin went from a fringe token discussed by technology zealots on the internet, to a serious discussion topic amongst regulatory institutions across the globe.  As previously reported by Bitcoinist, U.S. President Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and even Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have issued official statements highlighting their opinions about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Pompliano believes that future regulations will likely target fiat onramps such as wallet providers and crypto exchanges. The analyst conceded that these targeted regulations “could definitely hurt in the short term” as they will weigh on sentiment and deter people from investing in cryptocurrency.  Ultimately, Pompliano and many other analysts agree that regulations are something of an inconvenient truth. Nobody likes the idea of government oversight, regulation and tax compliance but in order for the sector to truly expand and mainstream regulations are required. Pompliano told CNBC presenter Joe Kernen that whatever regulations the G7 might cook up could it will “ultimately be a net benefit for Bitcoin in a long period”, as the asset will be more accessible to retail and institutional investors.  The context and tone of next week’s meetings could cast a short-term bearish cloud over the crypto-market but Pompliano remains confident on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.  The analyst pointed to the approval of Bakkt by the CFTC as proof that Bitcoin will continue to draw the interest of institutional investors.  Do you think the G7 will develop a multinational crypto regulatory framework next week?

Gox Rehabilitation Plan']","  Emilio Janus | Aug 21, 2019 | 14:00 Bitcoin has several big dates in the next couple of months which should be of interest to anyone with a stake in the network. Depending on how these pan out, we could well see renewed confidence and uptake, as well as another bull run. So what are we waiting for?   We learnt last week that after a regulatory quest which seemed to go on forever, Bakkt will finally launch its physically delivered Bitcoin futures product on 23rd September. Back in May, the company got so frustrated by a lack of action by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it self-certified. This gave the CFTC 10 days to raise an objection, which was clearly too much to ask. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) recently came up with the regulatory goods for the custodial solution, so all systems are now go. This is big news for Bitcoin as it opens the door to institutional investors and is a huge step forward for crypto industry legitimization in the US. The Securities and Exchange Commission is another regulatory body that could hardly be accused of urgency in its decisions. It has been repeatedly delaying decisions on several Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) for over a year. Some gave up trying, but two have persevered knowing that, eventually, the SEC could delay no longer. Well, this month we saw those final delays, meaning the final decisions on the Bitwise and VanEck ETFs must happen in October. Bitwise is due first, with VanEck following less than a week later, although the delays have often been announced together. Of course, this doesn’t mean that either fund will be approved, but if one is then it could again remove another hurdle for institutional investors to move into the space. Another long running saga in the Bitcoin world is the fallout from the 2014 hack and collapse of the MT. Gox exchange. Come 28 October, this too will see some form of resolution, as this is the final date for resolution plans to be submitted. Every time we have seemed to be nearing resolution of this, another party will come out of the woodwork, with an often spurious claim on the funds. The latest such claim was from CoinLab, which rather audaciously suggested that it had suffered damages of $15 billion. Seeing the victims of this heist finally compensated, will go a long way towards building confidence in an industry which often seems plagued by high profile hacks. By the end of October we should at least have a plan for this. Which date are you most excited about? Let us know in the comment section below! ",[]

Some are just pie in the sky, but others have delved deeper into what could drive BTC prices to a new all-time high in the months ahead. Crypto focused research firm, Digital Asset Research, has recently released a new bitcoin price prediction model. It makes the bold claim that, based on the premise of scarcity, bitcoin’s price will reach $60,000 by May 2020. This will increase its market capitalization to over a trillion dollars. The model has extrapolated previous price pumps to predict a future one. Its basis is on the BTC block reward halving which is due in May 2020. This usually bullish event has the effect of increasing the perception of a reduction in supply which in turn will increase demand and push prices higher. The study was based on an original one by twitter user and crypto analyst ‘PlanB’ which looked at monthly supply and price data, and calculated a stock to flow ration which equates to the inverse of its inflation rate. Previous halving events were analyzed and Digital Asset Research found that BTC price tended to peak about a third of the way through each halving cycle, with each high topping the previous. A continuation of this would result in a price ceiling in the next cycle around September 2021. The study also noted that a large cash flow would be needed to send bitcoin market cap up to the $1.25 trillion required to hit this price target. This could possibly come from institutional investors looking to hedge against fiat currencies that are being manipulated and devalued across the globe. If the current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions continue, it could come from a number of sources: currencies that are devalued or lose purchasing power, gold investors that view Bitcoin as a higher beta version of gold, or from currently negative-yielding debt, which recently topped $15T worldwide. Using the same methodology, the researchers concluded that the model does not apply to Litecoin which goes through reward halvings every 840,000 blocks instead of 210,000 blocks, and has four times the supply. The recent Litecoin halving has also been viewed as a possible precursor to what may happen to bitcoin in nine months. According to Longhash.com, which studied LTC metrics before and after the halving event, there is very little to go on as an indicator of what may happen to BTC. Litecoin price spiked before the halving but has dumped after it which was somewhat predictable but the fundamentals of the network have not changed. The price drop has been attributed to a wider crypto market decline rather than anything halving related. As a counter to the Digital Asset Research study, the bitcoin halving may too be underwhelming if Litecoin is anything to go by. Will BTC hit a new ATH before the halving? Add your thoughts below.

According to a statement released on its website on Wednesday (August 21, 2019), Cryptopia didn’t use individual crypto wallets. Instead, the Bitcoin exchange platform pooled customer funds into co-mingled coin wallets. Thus, the liquidators are facing a difficult time determining the amounts held by customers. Furthermore, Grant Thornton says it has to manually reconcile pooled wallet data with customer data information. An excerpt from the report reads: We are working to reconcile the accounts of over 900,000 customers, many holding multiple crypto-assets, millions of transactions and over 400 different crypto-assets). These must be reconciled one-by-one. At the start of the year, Bitcoinist reported that hackers managed to steal an undisclosed amount of cryptocurrency from Cryptopia. Subsequent details of the case revealed that the theft was close to $20 million. The statement from Grant Thornton also revealed significant progress in the area of customer data recovery. Its previous update had highlighted some difficulty in obtaining data of belonging to the hacked Bitcoin exchange in the possession of a U.S.-based data center. Back in May, the company had threatened to delete all Cryptopia data if not compensated with $2 million. This data contained details of the platform’s customer holdings and some cryptocurrency deposits. Grant Thornton says it is also taking steps to secure all cryptocurrencies in its possession to prevent another hack. Presently, the liquidators say their main concern is to preserve the integrity of all the available data as it continues the reconciliation process. Back in July, Bitcoinist reported that there was evidence pointing to the Cryptopia hack being an inside job. For affected customers of the hacked Bitcoin exchange, Grant Thornton also announced that they will have to fulfill the know your customer (KYC) requirements as part of any repayment process. Even customers that completely Cryptopia’s KYC step as part of their account opening will have to submit to this new validation process. Grant Thornton says it is also waiting for approval from the Court to commence the return of customer funds once it finishes the reconciliation process.

Allaire explained that the recent decline in the crypto market might be driven by holders who decided to take some profit. He said: Last week was a significant risk off week for equities. There were a lot of holders of digital assets whose portfolios were taking a hit and if they had gains, Bitcoin is up over 100%, almost 200% over the past 9 months, it was a place to take some gains. However, the correction doesn’t affect the coin’s appeal as a method of preserving value, especially for those impacted by a weakening economy. Year-to-date, Bitcoin’s price has been pushed by several geopolitical and economic fears, including those related to the Sino-US trade war, lower interests, devaluation of China’s Yuan, Hong Kong protests, and Brexit uncertainty, among others. On August 25-27, heads of G7 countries will meet in Biarritz, France. The world leaders might touch upon Bitcoin and crypto space, according to Allaire. However, it’s unlikely that we’ll see a crypto-related policy. Circle boss said: I don’t know that we’re going to see specific policy but certainly we’re going to hear some perspective out of there. As it turns out, some investors don’t recommend investing in Bitcoin thinking of it as a safe haven asset right now. Moreover, other safe havens like gold might not be the best investment choice despite the uncertainty in the global markets. Dev Kantesaria, portfolio manager of Valley Forge Capital Management, said in a recent interview with Markets Insider: They [Bitcoin and gold] are collectibles. You are actually not buying any protection, you’re simply speculating. To me, it’s no different than any other speculative activity in your life. According to Kantesaria, Bitcoin has some fundamental problems related to its limited use at the moment. Instead, the portfolio manager is bullish on the US stock market. He expects it to show generous returns during the next decade. Do you think investors should allocate part of their portfolio to Bitcoin in an attempt to preserve wealth?

Since then price levels have risen sharply testing resistance just shy of $11,000. An influx of new volume could propel price levels to $12,000 next week. On the 1 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see the formation of the recent ascending wedge. Similar to a rising wedge, however different in the sense that ascending wedges form prior to a down-trend and rising wedges form prior to an up-trend. Despite Bitcoin rising from $9,600 to $10,900 over the last 5 days, no real momentum has built upon MACD and price action has been reasonably slow and steady thus forming such a tight channel. It’s difficult to gauge whether the slow and steady price action indicates weakness in the uptrend, or strength at this point, however, we’ll know over the coming days. If price levels break down through the wedge support we know the uptrend was unsustainable and will likely re-test $9,600. Adversely, if the resistance point around $11,100 it’s likely that this resistance point will then become a support level. If price levels do break-down, confirmation of a new short-term downtrend will arrive once price action drops below the POC (Point of Control) level at $10,350. This is the strongest support before $9,600 and will be useful when trying to gauge the strength of the potential break-down through the wedge support as mentioned.  On the 4 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see the orange 500-day moving average has finally caught up to the current market price action, sitting just below at $10,200. This is a sign of consolidation which is evident on Bitcoin over the last few months since the high of $14,000, and will also act as a strong support level. The last three candles can be seen bouncing off of the 4 hour POC (Point of Control) at $10,560 within the ascending wedge. This a sign that perhaps the trend isn’t as weak as it appears on the 1-hour chart. There will need to be a large amount of selling pressure entering the market during the break-down in order for support levels at $9,600, $9,890, and $10,200 to be broken. 200 EMA (blue line) is sat right below the current market price and appears to be levelling out. This will also act as a strong support level. This in conjunction with POC right below the market price indicates strength in the current short-term trend. This will be confirmed once the resistance at $11,100 and $11,250 is broken. Do you think Bitcoin will break through the resistance at $11,100? Please leave your thoughts in the comments below!

It serves as yet another stark warning that governments and banks are in full control of people’s money. Only decentralized assets such as bitcoin would be immune from such monetary madness. According to reports a massive ‘cleanup’ of Ghana’s banking system has left tens of thousands of people wondering where their savings have gone. The crackdown has reduced the number of lenders by a third, and resulted in the closure of 23 savings and loans firms. It also triggered a run on fund managers which caused a selling spree and mass liquidation of holdings. An estimated $1.6 billion has been wiped out, which is over a third of the assets that private fund managers supervise for retail and institutional investors. Ghana’s primary financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has increased pressure on at least 20 fund managers it suspects of violating the rules. The SEC has blocked asset managers from receiving any new investments as they may be used to pay out existing investors. The massive run on holdings has left as many as 70,000 people desperately seeking answers as to where their savings have gone. Lord Mensah, a senior finance lecturer at the University of Ghana, commented; It’s cutting across all the finance houses and when it happens like that the government needs to step in to build confidence again. There’s nothing we can do apart from making sure that we create that necessary environment to regain investors’ confidence again. The likelihood of the government bailing out burnt investors is slim as the central bank targeted the savings companies servicing them. Many are already blaming the government for not having adequate provisions to prevent such financial fiascos. Financial Crime and Governance and Regulatory Expert, Kwadwo Kusi-Frimpong, wrote; The issue Ghana faces is more about having adequate system and controls in place to ensure that there is no room for such things to happen. Crypto industry observer ‘Rhythm Trader’ said that financial management should not need a middleman and bitcoin, with its ever expanding network, is the answer. The savings of tens of thousands wiped-out overnight. This is why saving your wealth should be simple and not need a middleman. Bitcoin fixes this. A banking crisis in Ghana means $1.6 billion of savings is now possibly gone for 70,000 investors. The savings of tens of thousands wiped-out over night. This is why saving your wealth should be simple and not need a middleman. Bitcoin fixes this. — Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) August 19, 2019  Many would argue that bitcoin’s volatility is keeping the masses at bay, coupled with the fact that it is a high risk investment. But for thousands of Ghanaians, what they perceived to be traditional investments have proved to be a much higher hazard. Can bitcoin solve the savings crisis? Add your comments below.

If you’re a bigger organization, the calculus is that if we join, it will not only be more full but we will be competing with everyone for transaction space,” he told the publication.  “It’s already expensive and it will be even five times more expensive because of us. There is pressure keeping people from joining, but improvements in scalability can do a lot in improving that.” Ethereum is on the cusp of major improvements precisely with the aim of preparing it for an influx of users with various goals beyond simply sending funds.  As Bitcoinist reported, the incoming updates, which together form what is known as Ethereum 2.0, will change Ethereum’s consensus model altogether. “The main problem with the current blockchain is this idea that every computer has to verify every transaction,” Buterin continued about the current status quo.  “If we can move to networks where every computer on average verifies only a small portion of transactions then it can be done better.” Asked whether security would suffer as a result of such changes, he replied any sacrifice would be “fairly modest.” “Scaleability is not the only problem. There are still challenges with usability, with account security and with privacy that are improving,” he added. Recent drops in the value of Ethereum’s native token Ether 00 have nonetheless compounded its publicity issues, particularly in the eyes of major Bitcoin advocates. ETH/BTC currently trades at 0.018 BTC, the pair’s lowest level since March 2017. Compared with when the market was booming in late 2017 thanks to the ICO phenomenon, a huge amount of value has evaporated. This, according to developer Udi Wertheimer, is unforgivable.  “It’s time for the ETH gang to wake up, smell the ashes, and take some responsibility,” he wrote in a series of strongly-worded tweets over the weekend.  “Their 2017 ‘blockchain everything’ narrative failed miserably and cost retail investors BILLIONS, dumped into scams supported by ETH naiveté[.] We’re toxic?

Silvergate Bank provides financial services to some of the industry’s top companies such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Xapo. According to a recent IPO filing from the company, they’ve seen an increased demand for crypto-backed loans from companies operating in the Bitcoin space. As a response, the firm is looking to offer fiat loans to their clients using crypto-currencies as the collateral.  Silvergate uses the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a system designed to facilitate transactions between cryptocurrency exchanges and clients. On top of loans, Silvergate has also expressed a lot of interest in adding stable coins to the SEN. They aren’t working with any stablecoin distributors at the moment, but according to the document they hold USD deposits backing several stablecoins. The bank has also talked about obtaining the NY State Bitlicense in previous filings, citing the desire to launch trust companies and become a custodian for institutional crypto-currency funds. The number one constraint for institutional investors is the lack of infrastructure surrounding the crypto-currency industry. Custodianship issues, uncertainties about legal regulations, and absurd price volatility is making investors understandably cautious. Once these issues are solved in a reliable and robust manner, we can expect to see much more money flowing into the Bitcoin space. Silvergate seems to be looking to solve the issues that aren’t up to the government, by providing a framework for legacy institutions to purchase, maintain, and safely store crypto-currency funds.  Another leader trying to build out infrastructure is Coinbase with their new Coinbase Custody service. CEO Brian Armstrong has talked on twitter about how the custody service is seriously picking up, with $200-400M invested into cryptocurrencies on a weekly basis. Crypto-backed loans may be something that convinces institutional investors that have been sitting on the sidelines that Bitcoin is not only here to stay, but a safe, alternative investment class. Would you be interested in cryptocurrency-backed loans? Do you think this will lead to more investors coming into the market? Let us know in the comments below!

Following the interesting first part of the latest self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto ‘reveal’, part two gave us an actual name. Unfortunately it gave us little in the way of compelling evidence to convince us that this was the name of the man who created Bitcoin. It all came across as more of a contrived excuse for why he couldn’t prove it.  The first instalment of the ‘reveal’ may have rambled its way through decades of extraneous detail, but the weaving in of the Bitcoin story was quite neat. Whilst perhaps a little contrived, it gave us enough points of contact to be plausible, without completely undermining itself. This was unfortunately not the case with part two. The rambling torrent of unnecessary minutiae was still there. But this time the ‘circumstantial evidence’ was largely replaced by unlikely explanations for anomalies. This alleged Satoshi Nakamoto pretty much shot himself in the foot right from the start: As an avid lover of numerology and astrology, I use both in my day-to-day life.  I do believe God is the ultimate mathematician… A hint of numerology may be an almost acceptable interest for a cryptographer. But no rational human being would even associate with an astrology believer, much less actually be one, and use it in day-to-day life. Even the numerology was contrived and clumsily applied. We found out why he chose certain dates, a 21 million bitcoin cap, even different email addresses. It was all just a bit… post-rationalised. The ‘reveal’ explained the original Satoshi’s writing style… and why it has changed for this reveal. Apparently he didn’t want to give himself away as a non-native speaker, so sent random paragraphs to be corrected by different editors. Allegedly, all of these editors were originally trained as typists, so used double space after a full-stop. This became part of Satoshi Nakamoto’s ‘style’. Supposedly he has also actively tried to make his English language worse since disappearing, so that he won’t be recognised as Satoshi. Of course, he could easily convince the world that he is Satoshi by moving some coins. Except that, of course, he can’t. Wracked with paranoia over someone discovering his identity, he always completely wiped any drive that he used either locally or remotely. He just kept one copy of his wallet and no back up. And then he lost it when a hard drive failed and the shop cheerily told him they’d replaced it free-of-charge. Well at least he bothered to come up with a reason that he can’t transfer any, eh Craig? Embarrassed at losing what would later become $19 billion worth of bitcoin, Satoshi settled down, got married, and got a job working for the UK National Health Service (NHS). There are other spurious details that don’t fit, like a “lethal” back injury, which he miraculously survived. He also took advice from an unbelievably sage colleague at the NHS, who had a far deeper understanding of Bitcoin and what Satoshi should do in regards revealing himself, than most of the crypto industry. I almost can’t bring myself to reveal the name, but you’ve made it this far… Born Bilal Khalid in Pakistan, he now resides in the UK. He watched the film, The Godfather, and changed his name to James Caan, believing himself to be ‘the godfather of digital cash’. His wife made him keep his birth name, so he is now James Bilal Khalid Caan. There’s also a badly digitally-altered photo. There will be no promised part three, as it was combined into part two. However we are promised an incoming shill for Tabula Rasa, his ‘clean-slate vision’ for Bitcoin. ‘I will forever be known as Satoshi Nakamoto.’ he concludes. That’s not something that I’d put any money on. Are you convinced by this new Satoshi Nakamoto reveal? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!

Hash rate is probably the first that comes to mind but daily volume is another indicator of how successful the system has been. Bitcoin was spawned by a movement dedicated to the freedom of financial oppression by central banks and governments. Personal spending power is governed by bankers and politicians, and in a world where state fear is increasing along with terrorism, capital controls will become more commonplace. People are being restricted on how and where they can move their own money. The bad few have changed everything for the good many, and ever invasive new money laundering and monitoring regulations affect everyone. Very few countries in the world allow their citizens to move their own money at free will and most will actively monitor bank accounts whether suspicious or not. The state controls the finances, not the individual. This is the problem and the answer has become clear in recent years. Bitcoin provides a decentralized form of currency that can be moved peer-to-peer without government intervention. At the moment it is early days in the industry and many are still reliant on centralized crypto exchanges that can suppress that freedom if necessary. The bitcoin network has grown to such an extent that an average $2 billion worth is being transferred every day. Industry observer ‘Rhythm Trader’ has acknowledged the true power of bitcoin. $2,000,000,000 worth of bitcoin are moved, on average, every single day using the network. No government, bank or third party had to verify these transactions, nor could they have stopped any of them if they wanted to.

The true power of bitcoin. 🔥 — Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) August 19, 2019  The power that this network is capable of is just one aspect of it. Yes, bitcoin can be truly disruptive and this is what governments fear. The escalating trade war between the US and China is a prime example as both governments want to devalue their own currencies to outdo their opponents. Bitcoin cannot be devalued unless it is perceived to be worth less by those that trade and hold it. The opposite is likely to happen however as global economic woes deepen. Scarcity is another aspect of bitcoin which was coded into it from the genesis block. Economist Misir Mahmudov took this philosophical view: Time = currency of life The key property of time is scarcity The only thing that shares this quality is Bitcoin Time = currency of life Be grateful to people who spend their time on you, not dollars We need money to exchange the products of our time Best money is that which is most similar to time The key property of time is scarcity The only thing that shares this quality is Bitcoin — Misir Mahmudov (@misir_mahmudov) August 19, 2019  Food for thought.

According to a filing dated August 19, the Supreme Court of the State of New York moved against Bitfinex and its sister company, stablecoin issuer Tether. A battle had ensued regarding the court’s jurisdiction over the case, which focuses on accusations by the New York Attorney General (NYAG) Bitfinex engaged in embezzlement of funds worth $850 million. “The Court disagrees with (the NYAG) that it is (or can be) premature for the Court to determine whether it has jurisdiction to issue orders impacting the rights of Respondents in this proceeding,” the filing reads.  That said, the Court finds based on the evidence and applicable law that it has jurisdiction – and a clear statutory mandate – to adjudicate this matter. Accordingly, (Bitfinex and Tether’s) motion is denied, and the temporary stay of the investigation is dissolved. As result of the ruling, both companies much supply the NYAG with whatever documentation it requires for its investigation into what happened to the cash. As Bitcoinist reported, the debacle began in August last year after $850 million was sent to a third party and became unintentionally quarantined. Later, Bitfinex admitted it did not have personal control over the funds, with a chain of participants and suspicion subsequently opening up as attention increased. The bitcoin exchange however held its ground in court, arguing the NYAG’s approach was overly broad and unsuitable.  The same judge granted a moratorium on document demands in May, something officials at the time greeted with open arms. “We look forward to continuing to challenge the New York Attorney General’s unmeritorious (sic) claims, and we will continue to vigorously protect our customers and assert our rights against those making false and unsupported claims against us,” a statement read. Bitfinex must now provide paperwork by October 14, with the content of the moratorium order otherwise remaining unchanged.  “…[A]lthough this case presents complex legal questions, the Court does not believe that is enough to warrant staying this case and further delaying or otherwise interfering with (the NYAG’s) investigation,” the filing summarizes. Bitfinex currently faces multiple battles. Last week saw stolen funds from a hack in 2016 suddenly begin to move again after a three-year dormant period. Mystery still surrounds the theft, which occurred in August that year and involved over 119,000 BTC (now worth $1.3 billion). What do you think about the Bitfinex lawsuit?

In a seemingly random turn of events, @Bitcoin, one of the Bitcoin industry’s biggest misnomers, suddenly began promoting Bitcoin 00, in line with its Twitter handle. In addition to retweeting another tweet critical of Bitcoin Cash and its main proponent Roger Ver, the account changed its Bitcoin whitepaper link from Ver’s Bitcoin.com website to its actual source, Bitcoin.org. @Bitcoin had previously spent several years promoting BCH, using its coveted Twitter handle to fool observers into believing the altcoin was in fact Bitcoin.  Commentators assumed Ver had control of the account, but in April 2018, he denied this, claiming he nonetheless knew the real owner was pro BCH. “He supports (BCH), is well known in the Bitcoin ecosystem, but doesn’t want to deal with incessant trolling so he has chosen not to make his identity public,” he wrote in a tweet at the time. After @Bitcoin began changing its tune, Ver was forced to respond, but on Reddit seemed less than concerned about its activities. Asked by another BCH user whether there was “anything we can do to save @bitcoin,” Ver simply replied, “Don’t know.” This carefree attitude appeared to spark a wave of conspiracy theories on social media, which continues to engulf some of cryptocurrency’s best-known names. Most focus on the tweet repeated by @Bitcoin, which in turn mentioned Ver’s Reddit exchange: “Roger claimed in the past that he knows the current owner of the handle. So, he either must know what happened with the account or there was a fallout between them. Yet he doesn’t reveal any information and lets his employees run rampant on r/btc with conspiracy theories instead.” Some believe the account has legitimately passed to a pro-Bitcoin entity, while others remain suspicious.  According to Twitter user BTC Sessions, the new owner has begun messaging users in private, requesting the community removes blocks instigated due to previous BCH content. Even Ver’s private life became fair game, with Litecoin creator Charlie Lee providing a tongue-in-cheek explanation for @Bitcoin’s sudden change of heart. “I have no proof of this, but I think the owner of @bitcoin must have had a romantic relationship with Roger Ver and recently broke up with Roger,” he wrote.  “That’s the only thing that can explain why @bitcoin stopped supporting BCH.” BCH, which forked off from Bitcoin in August 2017, currently trades at its lowest levels against the largest cryptocurrency in history.

Fun fact: it has offices in those regions. BitMEX said in a statement issued today that it is limiting access to users residing in Seychelles, Hong Kong, and Bermuda. The Seychelles-based exchange stated that it decided to go ahead with its decision to ensure “continued compliance.” It explained that it was restricting access to its bitcoin derivatives and exchange services in regions that hosted its headquarters and staffs. Seychelles, Hong Kong, and Bermuda will be added to the list of jurisdictions already restricted from access to BitMEX,” read the statement. “This change will have no financial impact on the business and will affect very few people. The BitMEX team will be reaching out to those who are affected. Following the announcement, BitMEX’s service now stands unavailable to the citizens of eleven regions, which also include the US, the province of Québec in Canada, Cuba, Crimea and Sevastopol, Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Sudan. BitMEX’s ban on local users came more than a month after BitMEX Founder & CEO Arthur Hayes debated noted economist and bitcoin skeptic Nouriel Roubini. The debate saw Roubini accusing Hayes of running a “total scam” under the guise of BitMEX. The economist said that BitMEX officials participate in a string of illegal activities, which include insider trading. The guy is a thug that is a public danger to thousands of small clueless investors who have lost their shirt because of his scam,” Roubini said about Hayes. “BitMEX should be prosecuted for fraud and banned fully.

The exchange soon founded itself amid a fresh controversy: Bloomberg reported that the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) began investigating the company for illegally offering crypto derivatives services to the US citizens. The exchange outright denied discussing the Bloomberg coverage, stating that it does not comment on “any media reports about inquiries or investigations by government agencies or regulators.” Many theorized that BitMEX is trying to impress regulators by keeping local citizens away from the risks of its highly-leveraged bitcoin trading services. Or, the exchange is proving that its executives do not trade on the platform. Nevertheless, its services remain geo-blocked, meaning users in banned regions can still access them using virtual private network services. Most recently, BitMEX received a notice from the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) over false advertising. The agency found that the exchange “failed to illustrate the risk of the investment,” “exaggerated the return on the investment” and “challenged whether it was misleading.” What do you make of BitMEX’s latest news?

The Friday “post mortem” revealed that an error on Coinbase sign-up page saved customers’ information on Coinbase internal web server logs – in a clear text. So a password writing which, say, looks like “123456” was appearing like “123456” to the staff at the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency firm.

Referencing a range of industry experts on August 18, local news outlet Business Korea noted the increasing tendency for Blockchain projects born in South Korea to seek out easier funding overseas.  Major international exchanges are the focus for CEOs looking to raise cash, specifically those with high volume residing in a pro-crypto jurisdiction. The reason, sources told the publication, lies in South Korea’s continued problems implementing its controversial cryptocurrency regulations. It notes, Experts point out that domestic blockchain projects are flocking to foreign exchanges largely due to tougher domestic cryptocurrency exchange market conditions. Investors cannot make or withdraw deposits in the Korean currency at Korean exchanges, Excluding the nation’s four largest exchanges, some 200 smaller exchanges cannot open real-name virtual accounts. This is one reason cryptocurrency investors cannot benefit from investor protection. International players such as China’s BW.com, Binance Labs and Bitholic keenly sense the demand from South Korea. Hence, they are either opening dedicated Korean won markets or, in the case of Binance Labs, directly sponsoring domestic Blockchain efforts.  As Bitcoinist reported, the pace of change within the exchange sector remains rapid, with different countries increasingly at odds over their permissiveness.  Just this week, Japan, one of the governments openly claiming to foster crypto exchange innovation while maintaining strict standards via a licensing scheme, added another platform to its domestic economy in the form of Rakuten’s ‘Rakuten Wallet’. Such moves are also impacting other exchange market players’ share of the market. As a result, South Korean exchanges are less appealing in 2019 due to low volume; out of the top one hundred in the world, few platforms are located under Seoul’s jurisdiction. “It is no exaggeration to say that 97 percent of domestic exchanges are in danger of going bankrupt due to their low volume of transactions,” Business Korea adds without naming specific sources. Other issues faced by local operators include, as of June, added responsibility for loss or theft of customer funds.  Earlier this month, meanwhile, commentators warned that the existing restrictions on cryptocurrency by lawmakers will throttle attempts to foster Blockchain innovation. When first implemented in 2017, attempts to deny Koreans the option of free crypto trade resulted in public unrest, with residents demanding senior politicians resign over their handling of the regulatory process.

Many bearish indicators point towards a break-down and lower low in the coming days.  On the 1 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see an ascending wedge has formed as a result of the bounce off the 0.382 Fibonacci level around $9,600. This trading pattern is inherently bearish, and there’s no reason to challenge that bias here. The ascending wedge now has three higher highs and three higher lows indicating the trading pattern has now been formed, and a break-down will likely happen in the coming hours and days. Volume is very sporadic at best with buying pressure quickly fizzling out and returning back to stagnant volume predominantly in favour of the bears. POC (Point of Control) at $10,400 acts as short-term support. If this level is broken, we will know that price levels have dropped out of the ascending wedge and will likely re-test the 0.382 Fibonacci level or create a lower low around $8,800, as mentioned in my previous analysis on Bitcoin. The current Bitcoin market price sits between both the 50 MA and the 200 EMA indicating consolidation which is evident by the ascending wedge. Price levels have now returned to both their 50 and 200-day averages, which is usually an indication of a large move ahead as typically coins will dump/pump, return back to their 50 and 200-day averages, and then repeat the cycle. On the 4 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see the descending volume within the most recent ascending wedge. This is a bearish sign as price action is rising yet volume is falling meaning the rising price action is unsustainable. Volume has also been descending throughout the last 6-8 weeks. MACD has just re-tested the median line at 0.0 despite decreasing volume making it likely MACD will reject crossing over the median line and create a lower low. We should expect Bitcoin price levels to break-down out of the ascending wedge over the coming days, break below $9,600 and proceed to create a lower low around $8,800. However, if enough buying volume enters then there’s a chance key resistance at $11,100 will be broken. This will signify the start of a new bullish short-term trend. To conclude, bitcoin is at a decision point as it trades close to the 200 EMA. We know if $11,100 is broken then further upside is expected. Adversely, if $9,600 is broken we know to expect further downside and perhaps a lower low. Do you think BTC will create a lower low over the coming days and weeks?

Which tokens are being manipulated the most, through bot accounts and inflated engagement? To compare, it looked at hype-to-activity ratio, or number of tweets per $1 million of trade volume.  Across the 450 cryptocurrencies considered in the investigation, there was an average hype-to-activity ratio of 1.02 tweets per $1 million of trade volume. So any token rated under this value would seem to be eschewing hype as a marketing tool and not really caring whether it was noticed or not. Either that or it’s flying under the radar The least overhyped cryptocurrency turned out to be Tether, scoring just 0.003. Whilst this may come as a bit of a surprise to some, as Tether is subject to a disproportionate amount of (mostly negative) hype, we must remember that it is used extensively in crypto-trading – not to mention it regularly hits daily volumes of over $20 billion. Other low scorers included EOS (0.008), Ethereum Classic (0.158), Cosmos (0.230), and NEO (0.231). Cryptocurrencies scoring values in the rough area of the average appear to be quietly confident in their own abilities. Having no need to blow their own trumpets, they can just concentrate on doing the job in hand. The majority of the top five tokens by market cap fall into this group. Bitcoin gets a 1.72, Ethereum slightly lower on 1.17, Bitcoin Cash slips below the average with 0.72, and Litecoin sits in the middle with 1.08. The eagle-eyed amongst you may have noticed one notable omission. It will come as no surprise to find XRP bucking the trend of high market-cap coins. It scored an impressive 4.07 hype-to-activity score. This actually spikes even higher to an ominous 6.66 when including popular hashtags like #XRPArmy and #XRPCommunity. Is XRP the cryptocurrency of the beast? But even XRP fades into insignificance compared to some of these over-inflated hype-beasts. The current top three comprises of TokenPay (911.1 Tweets/$1M), Electroneum (678.8), and Dragonchain (505.3). TokenPay has an astonishing 33 million percent higher hype-to-activity ratio than Tether. This level of ‘all hype, no trousers’ presents itself through tweets from hoards of bot accounts, fake followers, and manipulated engagement. For example, Electroneum has 127, 000 followers on Twitter, whereas BitMEX has only 65,000. And for those of you who only read the article to laugh at Justin Sun… I’m afraid you’re going to be disappointed. Tron scores a hype-to-activity rating of well below average at 0.544. Although, if we consider Facebook likes as a metric, Sun has *cough* over 6 million *cough*, whereas exchange Coinbase, with over 60 million users, has just 187K.","['Cryptocurrency', 'hype', 'twitter']"

Surprisingly, in May 2019 Venezuela’s central bank publicly published economic data for the first time since 2015 and the data shows that Venezuela’s inflation rate in 2016 was 274%, 863% in 2017 and 130,060% in 2018.  Hyperinflation in Venezuela is so bad that most citizens have to spend all their money immediately because if they hold off for a few days the currency will continue to lose value against the rising price of basic daily staples.   The majority of Venezuelans do not trust the bolivar, and in the past those who were unable to spend their income on the spot sought to purchase gold or the US dollar as a hedge against inflation.  Both options come with risks as organized crime and price gouges are always prepared to take advantage of those holding physical currency.  Fortunately, cryptocurrencies are easier to ‘hold’ and have become a safer option embraced by a growing number of Venezuelans. Both Dash and Bitcoin have become popular mediums of exchange and store of value currencies.  A recent study from the Ledger Journal investigated the role Bitcoin played in countries experiencing economic uncertainty and contributing analyst Jackie Johnson found that:  In countries where residents are under pressure from economic mismanagement, Bitcoin trading becomes critical. Two factors drive Bitcoin trading: one, there is pressure to purchase Bitcoin using local currency before it loses even more value; and two, there is a need to redeem for the local currency either past purchases or purchases made outside the country by friends/family, enabling residents to cope with rising prices. This results in an increase in Bitcoin trading in the local currency. Johnson’s findings are supported by data from LocalBitcoins which shows explosive growth in the number of peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions and all throughout 2018 and 2019 Venezuela and Argentina have continuously notched new all-time highs for peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions.  Despite the growth in Bitcoin transactions Venezuelan economist Danial Arraez says that mass adoption is still a distant target. Arraez said:  In the country there is still not enough adoption of bitcoin, because with few exceptions, cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and altcoins, are, in most cases, a proxy currency (substitute) to facilitate fiat exchange, with the USD-VES pair being the most traded, but without being able to set aside the VES-CLP (bolivars in Chilean pesos), VES-COP (in Colombian pesos), VES-ARS (in Argentine pesos), VES-BRL (in Brazilian real) and VES-PEN (in Peruvian sol) pairs. Interestingly, a Rhythm, a popular crypto analyst recently tweeted that if a person held $1 million worth of Venezuelan bolivars since 2013, this amount would now be worth less than $0.37.   Bitcoin might not have reached the level of mass adoption in Latin America, but if the situation doesn’t change it appears that will only be a matter of time before it does.  Do you think Bitcoin mass adoption will first occur in Latin America or a different region?

By now, for many, it has become irrelevant, and any new ‘revelation’ gains a healthy dose of cynicism. But here we are again, with a promise of an unveiling in little under 36 hours. Could it be different this time?  You could be forgiven for having a touch of Satoshi Nakamoto fatigue. In the past few months alone, we’ve endured multiple theories regarding an Estonian connection, a drug lord who invented Bitcoin purely to launder money, and a failed attempt at viral marketing (anybody actually use PAI news?). Not forgetting, of course, Craig Wright’s ongoing delusion in the face of mounting evidence of his serial forgery. So when a new website appears claiming that ‘all will be revealed’ in a three part series of posts… well you’ve got to expect it to be taken with a(n un)healthy pinch of salt. But that’s exactly what happened over the weekend. We even got to read the first part of the three-part reveal, and… it’s strangely compelling. The website bears the name ‘ Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance Holdings’, and the ‘Truth’ is as told to Ivy McLemore, a PR and marketing consultant… and apparently a man. So far, so readily dismissible as another waste of time marketing ploy. The site even admits that part three of ‘My Reveal’, along with the Nakamoto’s true identity, will provide details about Tabula Rasa, Satoshi’s vision (sorry Craig) for the future of Bitcoin. But if this is just another attempt to cash-in on the Bitcoin bandwagon, then whoever is involved has done a better job than most of the others. The fact that ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ has a beef against the banking industry will come as a shock to no-one. The fact that this beef harks back to the 1991 closure of the ‘World’s Sleaziest Bank’, BBCI might. Allegedly, part of his motivation was to redeem BCCI, even going so far as basing the name of Bitcoin on it; Bank of CredIT and COmmerce INternational. He also had trouble opening a bank account when visiting the UK. According to this latest ‘testimony’, Satoshi came from Satoshi Sumita, a Japanese Central Banker, who presided during a period when the country became the world’s largest creditor nation. Satoshi was also an exact match in Chaldean numerology (which also features greatly) for Nakamoto’s childhood nickname of ‘Shaikho’. Nakamoto came from Hal Finney, who helped him to create Bitcoin. Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto lived in the same California neighbourhood as Finney. He was later mistakenly identified as the Bitcoin creator by Newsweek. Satoshi Nakamoto is the number 55 in Chaldean numerology, representing the total and complete man. Finney also provided remote computers to work on, leading some to speculate that Nakamoto had been based in California. He had actually started his work in Pakistan, later travelling between Pakistan and the UK. ‘Nakamoto’ describes Finney as his Steve Wozniak, the technical genius who partnered Steve Jobs at Apple. So part one of ‘My Reveal’ is detailed, fits some of what we already know about Nakamoto, and explains some of the things that we didn’t know. And the best bit is that we don’t have to wait too long for parts two and three. Part two, available at 4pm EST today, will reveal more about how Nakamoto’s belief in Chaldean numerology influenced many of his decisions regarding the development of Bitcoin. It will also give all the facts about his 980,000 BTC personal stash. Then part three will be published just 24 hours later. Will we finally learn Satoshi Nakamoto’s real-life identity, and his vision for the future of Bitcoin? Craig Wright must be quaking in his loafers… or sitting smug in the knowledge that this is just a ploy, and he is the real… nah, just kidding, quaking in his loafers.

In a Twitter thread published on Saturday (August 17, 2019), Krüger outlined his argument for the bitcoin price going as high as $50,000 by 2021 at the latest. According to Krüger, there is a far greater weight of positive driving factors than any negative headwinds that could adversely impact the bitcoin price trajectory. An excerpt from the thread reads: Bigger picture, the upside is IMO considerably larger than the downside. Think $BTC will eventually break through $20K, in 2020 or 2021, and once it does, it should trade $30K, $40K and $50K fast. Must be long for when that happens, and enjoy the ride as others FOMO in. Currently, the bitcoin price is under resistance in the region above the mid-$10,000 level. thus, the top-ranked crypto has appeared range bound between $9,000 and $12,000.  Krüger also addressed the debate about a possible bitcoin price slide to $8,500 — the midway point of the current 2019 performance. Some commentators point to the unfilled CME futures gap at this price level as an indication of a likely retracement. For Krüger, filing the CME gaps isn’t a given pointing to the absence of significant support or resistance as such price levels. Furthermore, the focus on unfilled gaps often takes away from the non-stop trading activities occurring in the spot market. However, if bitcoin falls below $9,000 there is every likelihood of a steep fall to this $8,500 price mark. According to Krüger, any further downward slide should be taken as a “gift” — a buying opportunity in preparation to a slingshot advance beyond the current 2019 high. While the signs appear bullish for bitcoin in the long-term, Krüger believes that there are significant headwinds for BTC. The profitability for miners remains high as long as the bitcoin price performance remains positive. Thus, it wouldn’t be unusual for miners to “hodl” not just only profits but revenue to be plugged in to cover the cost of running nodes. However, this profitability encourages the influx of more miners which in turn raises the hash rate and by extension difficulty. More miners in a bull market often mean lower profit margins so participants aren’t “hodling” as much as before. Do you think the bitcoin price will reach a new ATH before the end of 2019?

Denmark semi-politely told him to… that it wasn’t for sale. Perhaps he would have more luck buying Bitcoin? Well, when it comes to bitcoin price, arguably the less said about the past week, the better. Unfortunately, it’s kinda my job, so I’ll try to make this as painless as possible. It all started reasonably positively. After a tumultuous weekend, a last-minute pump saw a bullish weekly candle closing at just over $11,500; the highest weekly close in over a year. Even Goldman Sachs was bullish on bitcoin, setting a short-term price target of $13,971, which seemed oddly specific. However, net capital flows out of five of the top bitcoin exchanges, along with low volumes troubling support at $11k gave a hint at what was to come. One analyst predicted that price would go as low as $8.4k to fill a futures gap. $11k fell… and then $10k and we were back to four figures. Perhaps a target in the $8000s was on the cards? Someone had other ideas, however, and price bounced back above $10k, before briefly dipping back below on Friday. Since then we have been in an uptrend but without the steam to push past $10,500. Price has stayed above $10k but looks anything but comfortable in the short term. Still, anyone obsessing over short-term bitcoin price changes is missing the point (or a degenerate gambler). Bitcoin is a long-term store of value, and still heading to $100k, at least according to the respected analyst, Murad Mahmudov. It seems like the Bitcoin community just can’t come to any consensus this week, as conflicting opinions were all over the news. And not just one which way price is going next. First up for discussion was Bitcoin’s alleged wealth distribution problem. Alleged by Civic’s Vinny Lingham, that is. He spent an hour-long debate with Dan Held getting hung up on a hypothetical $10million bitcoin, and whether Satoshi’s stash was ‘fair’. Then VanEck exec, Gabor Gurbacs, stepped in to say it was all a myth and everything seemed balanced to him. Bitcoin’s midweek crash could be down to a little known (outside of China) Ponzi scheme, or so alleged local expert, Dovey Wan. PlusToken had scammed over 200k BTC, which was starting to hit exchanges. “Not true,” said one analyst, who claimed the majority of tokens had been sent through coin mixers a month ago. Although arguably, the coins which came out of the other side of the mixers could well be flooding exchanges. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided that another two months of feet dragging was required before they could finally give approval or disapproval to a Bitcoin-ETF. Then out-of-the-blue the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) gave approval to Bakkt’s custody solution. The company’s bond delayed physically-backed Bitcoin futures product is now expected to start trading in late September. The only party remaining uncharacteristically quiet was BitMex, which is in the midst of a CFTC probe. Although CEO Arthur Hayes couldn’t resist the urge to poke his head above the Twitter parapet to promise that he will be back. Craig Wright has been caught forging documents again. The self-proclaimed creator of Bitcoin was using a series of Bitmessage communications as part of his defense, in the case between the estate of Dave Kleiman and himself in a Florida court. However, the creator of Bitmessage (as in actual creator, not self-proclaimed creator), Jonathan Warren, testified that the messages must be fake because the service hadn’t been released at the time of the message.

What’s going on? After struggling to hold above the $11,000 point earlier this week, Bitcoin price, at last, succumbed to selling pressure and dropped below $10,000 for the second time in three weeks. Prior to the drop, numerous analysts predicted that $10k would serve as a reliable bounce point as the price represents important psychological support.  Clearly, this was not the case and even after making a strong upside move from $9,500 to $10,450, Bitcoin still struggles to stay above $10,100.  Let’s take a look at what is keeping the king of cryptocurrencies down.  On July 14 Primitive Crypto founding partner Dovey Wan attributed the sharp sector-wide correction to bulk Bitcoin sells from PlusToken, a Chinese Ponzi scheme. The scheme managed to accrue 200,000 Bitcoin and more than 800,000 Ethereum from naive investors in China.  According to Wan, not every member of the PlusToken team has been arrested yet and data from cybersecurity auditing firm Peckshield shows that recently more than 1,000 Bitcoin was transferred to Huobi and Bittrex from PlusToken accounts.  Wan is convinced that the scammers are covertly shifting their funds “into small batches into exchanges, like 50 to 100 Bitcoin per batch.”  Wan also claimed that she recently stumbled across a chat where Chinese traders were saying that someone had been dumping 100 BTC non-stop on Binance.  If true, it is entirely possible that large back to back sales of Bitcoin could affect spot rate across exchanges but this sole event is probably not fully responsible for Bitcoin’s malaise.  The CME Bitcoin Futures gap is another popular topic amongst Bitcoin traders and many cite the existence of the gap as a reason why Bitcoin continues to drop below $10,000. A glance at a Bitcoin daily chart shows an $870 gap between $7,177 and $8,050.  The gap is simply the outcome of Bitcoin price moving over the weekend while the CME Futures are closed and the space denotes the difference between the previous close and the new opening price once the market reopens.  The gap is a cause for concern as traders set the price as a target that must be filled at some point, typically when an asset corrects and retraces to supports in the vicinity of the gap.  Many traders believe that Bitcoin must revisit this $7,100 to $8,500 range to truly correct before resuming its strong bullish trend to a new all-time 2019 high.  An assortment of crypto analysts have posted charts suggesting that Bitcoin has entered a lengthy consolidation phase and will continue to be pinned between $9,000 to $14,000 until more excitement and momentum build up over the 2020 halving event.   Earlier this week as the stock market took a horrific tumble over weakening macroeconomic fundamentals, fears of a recession sprang up as an economist focused on an inverted yield curve on treasury bonds.  This week the slope on US Treasury bonds became inverted and for economists and market analysts, this is typically an indicator that a recession could be on the way.  At the same time, Gold has continued to rise in price and many investors believe that Bitcoin is a similar store of value and hedge against volatility.  If the US and other countries truly are on the verge of a recession, one would increase inflow into Bitcoin and a significant increase in its market cap and value.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin is steadily dropping back towards $10,000 and $9,800 is the most immediate support level.  Do you think Bitcoin price will dip below $10,000 over the weekend?

Analysis from Peckshield suggested that about 1000BTC from PlusToken had flowed into Huobi and Bittrex since July. The reporting of this just after the crash which saw bitcoin price dip back into four figures led many to correlate the two. However, the TokenAnalyst review shows that very few PlusToken-associated addresses held any significant number of bitcoin and moved them recently. According to Shekhar: It doesn’t look like any of these addresses are exchange owned. So that was enlightening. We’ll keep an eye on this to see if they do move the 100s of millions into exchanges at some point. The reason that very few Bitcoin addresses associated with the scam contained much in the way of coins, was because they had already moved. TokenAnalyst did find thousands of bitcoin on the ledger belonging to the PlusToken team. But much of this money filtered into Bitcoin mixing services about a month ago. This correlates with Peckshield’s data that the coins started moving nearly-July. Its findings were only that about 1000BTC flowed into exchanges. The rest, according to the new research by TokenAnalyst, flowed into mixers. Something caused the market to crash on Wednesday. Wan tweeted of unconfirmed reports by Chinese traders that someone was continually dumping 100BTC batches onto Binance. It is not inconceivable that the freshly mixed coins from the PlusToken scam were being pushed onto exchanges for conversion into fiat. But of course, we always want a nice simple explanation for any market movement. Something that we can point to, and sagely say… “ah, yes. this was the reason.” because there isn’t a lot of comfort in “just because…” What’s your theory for the recent bitcoin price dump?

For these reasons, Morgan Creek Capital Founder & CIO, Mark Yusko thinks new types of protective ‘insurance’ such as Bitcoin may be warranted. While the traditional expectations call for a slow summer trading period, stocks have consistently traded under heavy selling pressure and posted some of their most volatile single-session performances of 2019.  Bearish catalysts first appeared in the U.S. bond space, where the yield curve inverted for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.   As a result, bond markets now meet three of the four main characteristics which define a ‘bubble’ environment for global government debt.  But despite this clear evidence of macro uncertainty, government bonds haven’t been this popular in more than a decade.   Mark Yusko, Founder, and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management responded to these developments in a recent interview with CNBC: I think we’ve got the biggest bond bubble we’ve ever seen in history… and it’s starting to show signs of deterioration. Unfortunately, these signs have become visible in most regions around the world.  Let’s take a look at the activity in bond markets for developed countries in several regions.   We should start with the world’s largest economy, where the U.S. Treasury market’s 30-year bond yield has an all-time low clearly in its sights: Source: Bloomberg Next, we can look at government bond yields from Sweden and Switzerland (two of Europe’s strongest and most stable economies) dating all the way back to 1870: Source: Longview Economics, Macrobond Last, we will look at perpetual bonds in the U.K. (also referred to as consols) dating back to 1700.  Essentially, these yields are tied to bonds that the government can redeem any time they want (without much advance warning): Source: Longview Economics, Macrobond Needless to say, these are all very long-term comparisons.  Essentially, these broader time frames make it much more difficult skeptics to dismiss the current trends as simple one-off events. By historical standards, equities remain overvalued even after their recent declines.  So if the relative safety of bonds continues to evaporate, it stands to reason that investors may start to see value in untapped areas of the market.   In his CNBC interview, Yusko offers some final advice to traders and goes on to explain why a long-term bitcoin investment can act as a hedge against global uncertainties:  People that watch the daily price of bitcoin are really missing the point.  The whole idea of bitcoin is that it’s a store of value It’s a chaos hedge, or ‘schmuck insurance’ as I like to call it.  What we need to think about is the long-term trend. What you want to do is own a piece of the network. You want to have 1, 2, 3 or 5% of your net worth in this asset. Do you think bitcoin works as a hedge against global economic uncertainty?  Let us know in the comments below!

The Intercontinental Exchange’s subsidiary announced on Friday that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) had given them clearance to acquire a New York state trust charter. That would provide Bakkt permission to operate as a Limited Liability Company (LLC), which means it can now custody bitcoins for physically delivered futures. The firm expects to launch the service on September 23. We have some news https://t.co/ykUvQ31cGz — Bakkt (@Bakkt) August 16, 2019  In a blog post published Friday, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler wrote that their bitcoin futures contracts have already received approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) through a self-certification process. Now, with a nod from NYDFS, Bakkt will introduce an institutional-grade custodial solution, called the Bakkt Warehouse, to meet the highest standard of oversight. Loeffler went on to add: “Bakkt bitcoin futures contracts will not rely upon unregulated spot markets for settlement prices, thus serving as a transparent price discovery mechanism for the benchmark price for bitcoin. The importance of this differentiator is only amplified by reports of significant manipulative spot market activity, and other concerns such as inconsistent anti-money-laundering policies and weak compliance controls.” The futures contracts will be exchange-traded on ICE Futures while ICE Clear US would clear them. That would mark the first time physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts would be listed on a federally-regulated exchange. The move would specifically comfort investors who wanted to speculate on bitcoin but delayed their plans owing to higher risks, lack of compliance, and market surveillance associated with global cryptocurrency exchanges. “Providing a trusted ecosystem is our first objective,” Loeffler said. “To do that we are setting a higher standard, including an institutional compliance and anti-money laundering program, settlement prices that are distinct from unregulated spot prices, comprehensive market oversight, a guaranty fund contribution, and insurance.” Bakkt initially had plans to launch its services in December 2018. The New York company intended to have CFTC approve its future contracts but constant regulatory delays prompted it to self-regulate the contract. Bakkt later announced that it would begin accepting users to test bitcoin futures contracts on July 22. Loeffler confirmed that Bakkt is still conducting user tests so it would continue “onboarding and testing with market participants.” The bitcoin price jumped by more than $500 in three hours after Bakkt announced its launch, indicating the news is flipping the market’s interim bias from bearish to bullish. At the time of press, the BTC/USD instrument was trading at $10,464 on Coinbase.

Moreover, the study forecast that the American cryptocurrency market will continue to expand in the next 12 months.  Nobl Insurance LLC, based in New Hudson, Michigan, carried out the research in May 2019 in connection with its new insurance product, Nobl Crypto, which is designed to protect the crypto market. Researchers noted that 6.72 million new crypto asset holders had joined the market by May 2019. And researchers concluded that the overall market grew by 48 percent last year. Although optimism about the global economy is waning, there is optimism about the crypto industry. The study’s findings suggest that we are on the threshold of a tantalizing opportunity of “an accelerating crypto market.” In effect, according to the press release, The research suggests that about 25 million Americans are considering buying crypto in the coming 12 months. 37% of cryptocurrency holders own over $5,000 USD of assets, and a further 8 percent hold over $50,000 USD in crypto. Despite numerous hacking attacks that have targeted the industry, investors still do not take appropriate precautions to protect their digital assets. According to the study, $1 billion worth of digital assets were lost in 2018 alone. However, researchers found that only 10 percent of holders keep their cryptocurrencies in offline cold storage. Our CEO & CIO on @blocktv taking about our new report  Will Tried by Fire Investors Take to Crypto Insurance? https://t.co/GPMmhQIjQW — nobl (@NOBLinsure) August 16, 2019  Thus, one of the critical conclusions of the Nobl study is that the cryptocurrency market requires insurance to sustain its growth. CEO and co-founder of Nobl Insurance Brandon Brown remarked, “The crypto market does not need a better gaming technology or a cool widget—it needs insurance!” Indeed, many have already highlighted the need for digital asset insurance policies designed to protect against crypto asset losses, theft, and general cryptocurrency capital loss. For example, according to American Express, Cryptocurrency investors are showing a strong demand for asset protection in the form of cryptocurrency insurance. But while some providers see the cryptocurrency insurance market as promising, many are wary of entering. Thus, to protect crypto holders, Nobl Insurance is developing a new solution, nobl Crypto.

The letters target those who have invested over 90% of retirement funds in a single asset class, such as property or cryptocurrency.  The letters from the tax office remind SMSFs that they have a ‘duty to comply with legal requirements to adopt investment strategies avoiding risky investments’. Not only is such an investment strategy arguably riskier than diversification of assets, in Australia, it is against the law. SMSFs involve individuals taking control of their own investment decisions when it comes to retirement funds, rather than relying on a professional fund manager. They are a major growth area for cryptocurrency businesses in Australia, representing around AUS$700 billion in assets. Those who do not follow the rules risk a AUS$4200 (US$2850) fine. Of course, if your crypto portfolio goes up then that may be worth breaking the rules for. Not that you heard it here. Alternatively, if you chose to invest all your retirement savings in OneCoin, or PlusToken, or BitConnect, or [insert sh!tcoin of choice here]… then maybe not. Well, let’s just say that you should be doing your due diligence on whatever you choose to invest in. The clampdown on single-asset class SMSFs comes after a ten-fold increase in limited recourse borrowing arrangements (LRBAs). These involve an SMSF trustee taking out a loan to purchase a single asset to be held in a separate trust. If the trustee defaults on the loan, the lender only has rights to the asset purchased with the LRBA. Over 40% of the SMSFs with LRBAs have 90% or more of the fund’s value concentrated in a single asset class. Most have invested the funds in a single property investment, but some put the lot into cryptocurrency. Australia has some of the most favourable laws worldwide regarding investing retirement funds into cryptocurrency. This was one of the reasons that Indian exchange, Zebpay opened an office there. CEO, Ajeet Khurana said: Australia happens to be the only developed country where retirement money, superannuation money, can very easily be invested into cryptocurrencies. The message on how much of your retirement funds can be put into crypto is not always clear though. According to the Bitcoin Australia website, “You can decide how much you would like to invest in crypto. This can be as little 1% or as much as 100% of your super – it’s completely up to you.” Which is not an accurate representation of the law. Would you include crypto in your pension fund?

The acquisition brings Assets Under Custody (AUC) to over $7 billion, servicing over 120 clients in 14 countries.  Xapo is a long-respected name in the world of cryptocurrency custody solutions. It has led the industry in developing security techniques to meet the rigours of institutional clients. In 2017 it hit the headlines for storing customers’ bitcoin in a fortified ex-military bunker in the Swiss Alps. By May 2018 it was holding around $10 billion in bitcoin for customers across five continents. CEO, Wences Casares, has long been a champion of Bitcoin, and Xapo’s mission is to make Bitcoin secure and accessible. Casares believes that any investor who doesn’t have at least a one percent position in Bitcoin is being irresponsible. Coinbase Custody started trading a year ago, with a remit to provide secure cryptocurrency storage for institutional investors. According to marketing it combined the ‘battle tested’ cold-storage solutions employed by the Coinbase exchange, with an institutional-grade broker/dealer. It quickly added a raft of additional crypto-assets to its original four of BTC, ETH, BCH, and LTC. However, there were questions as to whether institutions would immediately trust the offering. Certainly, while the bear market was in full swing, growth in AUC was slow. It wasn’t until the bulls really started taking control again in May this year, that AUC crossed the $1 billion mark. But since then, growth has been steadier, and with this latest acquisition of Xapo’s institutional business, Coinbase Custody are claiming over $7 billion in held assets. There are many who think that crypto-custody is the final hurdle to institutional adoption of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. This area is certainly where a lot of resources are currently being deployed. Bakkt is still waiting on approval from the New York authorities for its custody solution, before it can start offering its physically backed bitcoin futures products. Fidelity’s move into crypto-custodianship was supposed to remove one of the final barriers to institutional adoption back in March. Even the South Koreans are getting in on the act, although technically, the legality of cryptocurrency in the country is still in question. We are still waiting for the expected flood of institutional investors, but steps are certainly being made. Whether their eventual arrival will be a positive thing is another question entirely.

Speaking to news magazine Cheddar in an interview on August 15, Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, said preparations were underway to get Binance US to market. “I would say in a couple of months now… I don’t want to promise any fixed dates… there’s a lot of work being done and a lot of things going on in flux, but I would say in a month or two,” he told the publication. The latest hint will doubtlessly excite US cryptocurrency traders, who remain shoehorned in by mixed regulatory practises on a local and national level.  As Bitcoinist reported, many major crypto platforms have frozen US residents out of using their offerings in order to avoid legal complications. Derivatives giant BitMEX is currently at the center of an investigation over alleged failure to stop US traders signing up for its services. Continuing, CZ likewise said Binance would be forced to segregate its US product due to local differences. Specifically, Binance will not offer its product to New Yorkers due to not having a BitLicense, the highly controversial document introduced in 2015. “…Our local partner doesn’t have the BitLicense, so I guess the short answer is no initially,” he said about whether Binance US would debut in New York. Commenting on the regulatory status quo in the US, CZ appeared less frustrated than many business leaders, notably Kraken CEO Jesse Powell. “In a large market, it is harder to regulate, because you have more people, more cases to consider,” he said. “Whereas in a small market, it’s much easier to make the rules very relaxed and then examine issues on a case-by-case basis.” Currently, the US is heading multiple legal processes involving well-known cryptocurrency entities. Among them is Ripple, the supposed issuer of cryptocurrency XRP, accused of selling unregistered securities. The same accusation forms the focus of a lawsuit against Kik, the Canadian instant messaging platform which conducted a $100 million initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017.  October meanwhile also forms the next deadline for authorities to decide whether they will allow a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to debut on the US market.  Opinions on the likelihood of an approval vary, the process already dragging on for over two years since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initially denied permission in March 2017.

Since the beginning of the year, BTC/USD has generated gains of 172%, outpacing the returns of both the NASDAQ Composite (at +16.6%) and the S&P 500 (at +13.2%) over the same period.   However, technical indicators suggest crypto investors might consider taking gains on portions of their positions if bitcoin trend reversals begin to unfold.  A recent tweet from Peter Brandt highlighted the bullish nature of this year’s bitcoin action, citing momentum readings which placed the rally within the context of price moves visible from 2015-2017:  Brandt’s trend model places a virtual “line in the sand” just below psychological levels at $9,000, which is an area that has worked previously as a support-turned-resistance level propelling BTC prices into five-digit territory:  BTC/USD – TradingView.com More importantly, the latest declines have sent prices through the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), which is a metric that tends to be watched more closely by the market’s daytraders.  As we can see, this is the third time BTC/USD has fallen through the 50-day EMA since March of this year. The lower highs posted during the June 28th – August 6th rally suggest a near-term top may have formed in BTC/USD.   Ultimately, this short-term bearish momentum could force a test of Brandt’s critical price levels.  The rapidly ascending 200-day EMA has the potential to work as an additionally supportive factor for BTC long positions.  However, markets would likely need to see a period of consolidation in order for price/time metrics to align in ways that keep valuations elevated above the $9,000 level. Given bitcoin’s recent move to close at its highest weekly candle in over a year, any downside breaks may have the potential to take many crypto traders by surprise.  Turbulence in both bond markets and fiat currencies has created summer volatility levels that are far outside of the historical averages. Options traders are currently betting that even more volatility is likely to flood the market, so it may not be a significant surprise to see similar expectations start to creep into the price action of bitcoin and other cryptos in the near-term.

The founder & CIO on Wednesday referred to bitcoin’s dwindling price action against an already gloomy macroeconomic outlook. Recognizing that investors should have perceived the cryptocurrency as a safe-haven asset by now, Kling doubted whether or not the nascent asset is ready to assume the responsibility like its established peers, including gold. “It’s like maybe BTC is strong enough to swim in the pool right now but not in the ocean,” he added. Lots of talk about BTC as a safe haven lately. Hasnt acted like that last few days. Why? Could be crypto specific mkt structure issues.

The index tanked by 800 points, prompting investors to flee to safety in traditional hedging assets like bonds, gold, or even Japanese Yen. Bitcoin, at the same time, appeared like an unnerving asset to those investors. The cryptocurrency slipped close to 9 percent on the day, bringing its weekly losses to as much as 14.40 percent. Bitcoin is Down More than 15% This Week | Image Credits: CoinMarketCap.com Meanwhile, US stocks disappointed on Thursday as the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to a three-year low. The 30-year US government bonds yield also dropped below 2 percent for the first time since the 1970s. Investors visibly dumped riskier assets amidst the fear of recession and renewed trade tensions between the US and China. They moved their capital to perceived safe-haven assets, including bonds. Meanwhile, Gold underperformed, with analysts predicting that it would undergo a downside correction in the coming months on a technical basis. The yellow metal’s fundamentals nevertheless remained on cloud-nine – same as bitcoin. Money managers and large speculators stressed that dovish central bank policies could push the yellow metal further up. Similar arguments projected bitcoin as a bullish asset among institutional investors. Kling, on the other hand, noted that bitcoin’s safe-haven tag worked impeccably against the US-China trade war fiasco. Nevertheless, the same title ran out of fuel against a broader, global economic slowdown. “One instance doesn’t make a market,” Kling added. “May just be the crypto market doing its thing.

Continuation of the pull-back to key support around $8,800 is likely over the coming days.  On the 30 minute chart for XBT/USD, we can see the sharp pullback that has taken place over the last 2-3 days. A clear influx of new volume has taken place throughout this pullback, initially bearish selling momentum that has now turned into a mixture of buyers and sellers. Price action was met with bitcoin buyers around $9,500 just above the 0.5 Fibonacci level indicating this is the predominant short-term support to look out for. Strong support between $9,890 and $10,170 mentioned in my previous analysis has pulled price action back up to this level. It’s likely sideways consolidation will take place within this support range over the coming few days before a continuation of the pull-back, or a short-term trend reversal. Alternatively, price levels might rally up to $10,750 support essentially refuelling for a further pull-back and trapping buyers who think the short-term bitcoin trend has reversed. RSI has clearly entered into the oversold region during this pull-back, taking the RSI momentum to the lowest point visible on the 30-minute chart. This means selling momentum will likely come to a halt over the coming days as momentum dies out. In order for bitcoin price levels to dump further without any form of sideways consolidation of brief rally upwards, there will need to be another large jump in selling pressure, which is unlikely. On the 1 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see the 200 EMA heading towards the 50 MA in a bearish fashion. It’s likely a bearish MA cross will occur over the coming 24-48 hours whilst price action goes into a short-term period of consolidation ahead of another drop. Another drop will create a lower low completing the descending channel on the daily. Three lower lows and three lower highs will be completed on the daily timeframe. Typically, descending channels that form as a result of a sharp up-trend are inherently bullish. Key support levels to look out for if price levels continue downwards to create the third lower low as discussed as $9,130, $8,800 and finally $8,100. It’s important to note that if the final support at $8,100 is broken, the overall short-term sentiment will be no longer bullish and traders will likely be put-off entering into any long positions.

In a tweet August 15, Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset strategist and director at investment management giant VanEck, took claims the Bitcoin supply was centralized to task.  Comments had previously appeared from sources such as Civic CEO Vinny Lingham, who raised concern at the idea that 80% of available bitcoins resided in just 2% of wallets. As Bitcoinist reported, others argued the metric held little meaning, as a huge number of wallet addresses contained next to no funds at all and were all but disused.  Nevertheless, a to-and-fro ensued, with technical sources ultimately pointing to evidence the overall supply is becoming more and more decentralized with time.  Gurbacs agrees. “Ownership seems balanced,” he summarized, noting that the addresses holding the biggest amounts of BTC are “often exchanges with millions of clients.” 62% of the supply is held in around 14,000 wallets, he added, noting that the measurement does not take into consideration a user having multiple wallets under their control.  The status quo for Bitcoin distribution is likely to undergo interesting shifts in the future as supply decreases.  As reported by Bitcoinist previously, the upcoming block size halving in May 2020 will kick off the final – and longest – phase of Bitcoin’s minting process. As of this month, 85% of the total supply has been mined, and the remaining 15% will take until 2140 to enter circulation. Of those roughly 17.8 million bitcoins previously available, a significant section is locked up, likely forever, due to misplaced keys or other accidental circumstances. Statistics place the proportion of ‘lost’ coins as high as 20%, meaning competition for the remainder will become ever tighter as more lay users come on board. Talk of supply meanwhile comes at a conspicuous time this month, as controversy brews about the impact of centralized control on altcoins. Specifically, it is Ripple and its associated XRP token at the center of speculation, after the company stepped up its sell-offs to break records in 2019.  Now, confidence among already skeptical commentators appears all but gone, with veteran trader Peter Brandt claiming Ripple’s practises would ultimately lead to major price losses.  “The chart pattern for many, many months has shown the distribution of XRP by Ripple — it has manipulated the price to hold support.

It shouldn’t be as these large swings are nothing new and will happen time and time again. Yet still the panic ensues as traders quickly liquidate positions for fears of further losses. But are the whales doing the opposite? The BTC fear index, a measure of fear and greed, has plunged to a low not seen since the depths of crypto winter in 2018. A 245 day low was hit as the index plunged to 13 in terms of ‘extreme fear’. The last time it was this low was when bitcoin dumped to $3,200 in mid-December. The scale is zero to one hundred with the bottom indicating ‘extreme fear’ while the top end is ‘greed’. The fall in the index correlated with the BTC dump below $10k which marks the fourth time since the rally began bitcoin has been in four figures. The platform derives its index data from five factors: Volatility, Market Momentum/Volume, Social Media, Surveys, Dominance and Trends. Research director at The Block, Larry Cermak, observed that two thirds of Coinbase customers with large BTC holdings have actually been buying over the past 24 hours. “Interestingly, according to Coinbase’s data, 67% of customers with large BTC holdings (top 10%) are buying rather than selling in the last 24 hours.” Interestingly, according to Coinbase's data, 67% of customers with large BTC holdings (top 10%) are buying rather than selling in the last 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/mOfNMbscuc — Larry Cermak (@lawmaster) August 15, 2019  He followed up with 88% of Coinbase customers with large XRP holdings are buying rather than selling in the last 24 hours. Considering that XRP prices fell to their lowest levels in almost a year over the past few hours, it would indicate a lot of ‘dip buying’ going on. The recovery is already in motion, for bitcoin at least. The foray into four figures only lasted seven hours as BTC is back over $10k again according to Tradingview.com. From the dip of $9,470, bitcoin has made over $500, or 6%, back to its current price of 00. Things happen so fast on crypto markets that most will have slept through this latest dip and missed the opportunity to get in at four figures. In all likelihood there will be another chance though as several analysts have eyed a further dip resulting in a lower low below $9k. The price action over the rest of the day will be critical for BTC’s next move. If the whales have been accumulating it will be heading back upwards pretty soon. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the altcoins. Will bitcoin bounce back today? Add your thoughts below.  ","['bitcoin', 'btc', 'coinbase', 'fear index', 'fud', 'whales']"

Biggest money printing in history. Biggest credit bubble in history,” they summarized. The 3rd 100bn+ bank bailout in China this year.

Both institutions have total assets of over 500 billion yuan: Baoshang 576 billion and Jinzhou 723 billion. In total for all three banks, the figure stands at a giant 2.719 trillion yuan ($386.3 billion). The sheer size of capital at stake appeared surprisingly under reported in mainstream media, with cryptocurrency sources notably more vocal given Bitcoin’s recent boom occurring on the back of the US-China trade war. China’s credit bubble – banking assets as a percentage of GDP – is now the highest out of any nation at any point in history. According to data from global macro asset management firm Crescat Capital, at almost 300%, the statistics dwarf Europe’s sovereign debt crisis of 2011 and the US housing market bubble of 2007.  CryptoArbitrage spelled out the bottom line for cryptocurrency fans if China’s predicament spills out of control. “Bursts = bullish for Bitcoin,” the commentator said.  In the short term, however, it appears excitement over Bitcoin as a way out of exposure to such risks has fizzled.  Critics have already argued that US-China relations and the Hong Kong protests did not result in a Bitcoin buying spree, while a temporary lull in the trade war nonetheless coincided with BTC/USD dropping almost 20% this week.  China’s central bank is meanwhile preparing the debut of its own digital currency, which officials this week said was nearly ready for launch.  As local news outlet Shanghai Securities News reported, Mu Changchun, deputy director of the People’s Bank of China, said the new currency would neither change existing monetary policy nor compete with the yuan in any way.  What do you think about China’s bank bailouts?

Little known outside of China, PlusToken scammed over 200k BTC and 800k ETH, which are now hitting exchanges in batches.  Started mid-2018, PlusToken was a classic Ponzi scheme offering high-yield investment return. There were four layers of membership structure, offering increasing dividends. By early 2019, it had a claimed 10 million members. Correction, this fucking scam at least scammed over 200K $BTC as I dug out my old chats to compile all their wallet addresses this is nuts https://t.co/E8bJFIf8h8 — Dovey Wan 🗝 🦖 (@DoveyWan) August 14, 2019  The core team were apprehended by police two months ago and will be in jail for decades, according to Wan. However, the reported $3 billion of cryptocurrency they scammed out of members has not been recovered. Many of the Bitcoin wallet addresses used are believed to be multi-sig, leading to speculation that some key holders remain at large. Security audit firm, Peckshield, has been monitoring money-flow from the PlusToken wallets, and found that since early-july about 1000 BTC has gone into Huobi and Bittrex exchanges. Funds have been moving in small batches of 50-100 bitcoins per batch. Unconfirmed reports from Chinese traders suggest that someone has also been consistently dumping 100BTC batches onto Binance. This is also believed to be related to PlusToken. One of the big questions around all this is ‘Why are we only hearing about it now?’. Again, according to Wan, there are three main reasons that exchanges have not paid attention. The main one being that the scam has not been known outside of China, with the possible exception of South Korea. Added to this, Chinese exchanges didn’t act because the case has officially been ‘closed’ by Chinese police. Finally, police didn’t work with the exchanges, because cryptocurrency exchanges are officially banned in China. Both Peckshield and Chainalysis are monitoring the coins involved in the scam, but exchanges must also get involved. There is potentially little that can be done about tokens which have already been cashed out. However, exchanges are able to freeze incoming tokens relating to known scams. The important thing is to ensure that the relevant parties are aware of the situation. Because, 200,000 BTC flooding the market is bad news for everyone.

High selling volume indicates further downside over the coming days. On the 2 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see support above $11,000 has been broken convincingly with a clear increase in selling momentum. Bears are in control of the short-term price action as price levels approach key support between $10,170, and $9,890. 50 MA and 200 EMA have yet to cross down over each other meaning a bounce could happen beforehand resulting in a continuation of the bullish short-term trend. Overhead resistance around $11,100 stemming from the yearly high around $14,000 is the main resistance point to look out for if price levels do proceed to bounce. If this resistance point is broken price levels will likely re-test the yearly high. There’s a chance BTC will make a new lower low over the coming days and weeks to put fear into long traders before the real breakout of the overhead resistance mentioned. It’s likely $8,100 will be the lower low region. 0.5 Fibonacci level at $9,400 is also a key support area to look out for however, it’s much more likely that Bitcoin price will create a lower low. On the 30 minute chart for XBT/USD, we can see the small rising support level around $11,100 that has recently broken. This break-down was met with clear selling pressure indicating bulls are no longer in control of the short-term trend. POC has yet to move down and still sits at the previous asymmetrical triangle break-down point at $11,700. If this POC doesn’t move down over the coming days it’s increasingly likely that a bounce will occur. The medium-term bitcoin price trend is still very much bullish, it’s important to not let short-term bearish price action to cloud judgment. As long as $8,100 region holds the current market price action is merely required volatility in order to sustain such bullish momentum that took price levels to $14,000 from the depths of $3,000. Selling momentum will need to come to a halt with a clear influx of bullish volume for a bounce to occur. Key support levels to look out for during a continuation of the short-term pullback is $10,100, $9,800, $9,450, $8,800 and $8,100. If the last support level is broken the trend is no longer bullish and will be hard to gauge re-entry points. Do you think Bitcoin price will create a lower low over the coming days?

The Seychelles firm took a vow of silence shortly after its name popped up in a regulatory probe. Last month, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) allegedly sent letters to BitMEX for offering services to US customers without obtaining a license. The report visibly prompted the firm’s clientele into panic-withdrawing their cryptocurrencies. As of July 24, BitMEX had withdrawn $125 million worth of money off its cold storage. Effective 15 July 2019 at 15:15 UTC, BitMEX will reintroduce Kraken into its indices following the resumption of trading on Kraken. See our blog for details: https://t.co/4EogEtB0YN — BitMEX (@BitMEXdotcom) July 15, 2019  The last BitMEX tweet was on July 15, 2019. The continued distrust fuelled by an aggressive silence from BitMEX and its top executives on the CFTC matter is appearing to cost the exchange its top spot. Over the past few weeks, news platforms are emerging from all directions that offer similar cryptocurrency derivatives solutions. The most renowned is the one by Coinbase. The US-regulated cryptocurrency exchange announced Blade, which would be live in about three weeks from this time of writing. Coinbase’ latest venture also raised a $4.3 million funding from top Silicon Valley venture capitalists. That marks one of the first alarm bells getting sent towards the BitMEX team. ‘Blade‘ threatens to cut away a good portion of BitMEX’s clientele, partially because its likely to get a regulatory blessing, and offers 150x leverage on BTC/USD and BTC/KRW trades. BitMEX, on the other hand, continues to run its business while providing a 100x leveraging option under a doubtfully regulated environment. As if BitMEX did not already have enough competitors trying to replace it as the top cypto derivatives exchange in the world, here's one more: #Altcoins #bitcoin #Blade #derivativesexchange #Exchanges #NewCryptoExchange https://t.co/rROREJKprd pic.twitter.com/eHn8ZWjW2d — Coin Market Share (@coinmarketshare) August 13, 2019  Blade aside, BitMEX is also taking the competitive heat from StormGain, a margin trading exchange which boasts of 100x multiplier trading without needing users to KYC themselves. Then, some firms were already in the game but were too little to get noticed before the $4 billion volume size of BitMEX. PrimeXBT, for instance, is competing with the Seychelles exchange with its $100 million worth of daily volume and –  again – 100x leverage solutions. Top cryptocurrency exchange Binance and financial trading firm eToro offer similar crypto derivatives solutions, but their leverages remain dwarfed. BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, who debated noted economist Nouriel Roubini right before he took a break from Twitter, has reappeared on social media, meanwhile. He appears to be travelling and promises to return to work in September. But to what Hayes would return is still something one cannot predict: a competitively-beaten BitMEX, arguably?

Wright (CSW) is once again being accused of forging documents as part of the Kleiman v. Wright case. Redacted court documents from a hearing held back in late July show Bitmessage developer Jonathan Warren providing testimony which shows Wright forging documents. Back in early 2018, Bitcoinist reported that Dave Kleiman’s estate sued Wright for stealing about 1 million BTC. In response, Wright alleged that Kleiman signed away the sum as part of a blind trust (Tulip Trust). Part of Craig Wright’s defense was a series of correspondences sent on the Bitmessage platform describing the trust process as well as the escrow wallet for the trust. However, Warren told the court that these correspondences were likely forged because the messaging platform hadn’t gone live as the time reflected in the “proof” submitted by Wright. An excerpt from the transcript of Warren’s cross-examination reads: Q: Do you see the bottom message in this… in the box… in the “from” field? A: Yes. Q: It shows an address beginning with BM-2C? A: Yes. Q: And it also shows a received date of October 22, 2012? A: Yes. Q: What does that tell you about the message? A: It tells me that something has been faked. Either the date has been faked or the screenshot has been faked. Q: Why do you say that? A: Because Bitmessage wasn’t released that time back in October of 2012. According to Warren, the communications protocol for Bitmessage went live November 19, 2012, almost a month after Craig Wright claims to have communicated via the platform. This revelation isn’t the first forgery accusation against Wright. Back in July, prosecution counsel accused Wright of forging the trust deed based on an inspection of the metadata of the documents submitted by the self-proclaimed Bitcoin creator, dated October 23, 2012. According to the details at the time, the document contains copyright elements that could not have existed earlier than 2015 — two years after Kleiman’s death. Many in the crypto space continue to dispute Wright’s claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto — the creator of Bitcoin. Craig Wright has even taken to the courts, suing those who publicly debunk his claim and label him a fraud. As recently reported by Bitcoinist, Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack released his defense in the libel suit brought against him by Wright, calling it a “waste of time.” Do you think Wright could face perjury charges for these forgeries?

Financial experts warn that the coming pension crisis is of such a magnitude that it will eventually affect everyone. Now, some are looking into Bitcoin as a potential savior of pension plans.  The deepening of the pension crisis is due to the difference between how much a pension has to pay out versus how much money the pension has available to pay out. Now, this gap is expanding. According to Moody’s Investor Services, public pensions are already underfunded by $4 trillion. And, Moody also announces that pension costs will rise through 2020. So, the pressing question is, how to cover the $4 trillion gap? In the 2015 audit of state pensions, the avg yield was 3.6%. 6% of investments in ""non-government securities."" If 0.3% of all assets were invested in #Bitcoin, the pensions would have returned 19.20%. 5.3x the current rate – saving dying pensions.#Cryptocurrency #DeFi pic.twitter.com/POPGQIOTXK — Adam Cochran (@AdamScochran) August 8, 2019  Adam Cochran seems to have found the answer, at least, until population growth returns to the levels that existed when pensions were devised. In his newsletter Coffee and Coin, he puts forward an argument for how Bitcoin might save pension funds. Cochran’s article describes how in 2015 the U.S. state and local government pensions distributed their $3.8 trillion in assets, from which only a modest annual return of 3.6% was earned. Moreover, Cochran specifically highlights Other nongovernmental securities. These are assets that do not adhere to an institutionalized process for public trading on exchanges. Thus, they are usually the riskiest assets held by the pension fund.  So, if pension funds seek to invest part of the money allocated to other nongovernmental securities in Bitcoin, the annual return would be dramatically higher than the current return of 3.6%. Cochran explains, If in 2015, the state pensions had taken 5% of that 6% set aside for “Other nongovernmental securities” (a.k.a 0.3% of their overall assets) and invested that in Bitcoin, then the pensions overall return would have been 19.20% annually. In effect, Cochran affirms, “That overall rate of growth, over the past 4 years would have amounted to around 171% yield, almost doubling state pensions from $3.8T to $6.5T in that time.” Bitcoin-based retirement instruments have been attracting the interest of young people, as well as influential politicians. Crypto and blockchain journalist Rachel Wolfson wrote on Bloomberg: “Interestingly enough though, one of the main reasons millennials are investing in cryptocurrencies is to save for retirement funds.” Indeed, investors are already putting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies in IRAs (individual retirement accounts), such as BitcoinIRA. This service facilitates the transfer of an IRA or 401K fund to a Bitcoin IRA. BitcoinIRA claims to have already processed USD 350 million in the past 12 months. In addition, influential GOP politician Ron Paul endorsed Coin IRA, which is a subsidiary of Goldco. Coin IRA also offers investments in Bitcoin. Its website claims: “A mere $200 investment in Bitcoin in 2011 would be worth well over USD 1 million today! That’s over 500,000% return in just a few years.” Do you think Bitcoin will become a mainstream retirement investment opportunity?

Stemming from a statistic provided by Civic CEO, Vinny Lingham, that 2% of wallet addresses hold 80% of BTC, it was countered by Interchange co-founder, Dan Held, and hosted by former Coinbase engineer, Preethi Kasireddy.  So… Does Bitcoin have a wealth distribution problem? Before the debate started, the participants introduced themselves and their positions. Lingham questioned whether Bitcoin has lost sight of its end goal. Sadly, for the rest of the hour it felt like Lingham had lost sight of the end goal of the debate. The problem was that he immediately posed, then continued to pressure Dan Held into confronting an extrapolated hypothetical situation. If bitcoin price magically hit $10 million today, would there be a problem? Held pointed out that this was not realistic, and that HODL waves show that the distribution of BTC increases as price goes up. Naturally, because everyone has a price that they will sell at, and as profits increase HODLers will buy things with their gains. This is not to mention that the market cap of Bitcoin would then be 6 times the total amount of narrow money in the world. If the assumed 50 million people who own bitcoin (less than 1% of worlds population), suddenly own 6/7 of the worlds money supply (which has essentially just added 600% to the previous total money supply), then of course, there will be a whole multitude of problems. But that is clearly never going to happen. For starters, way before this point, the whole concept of fiat money becomes irrelevant. Lingham has either never heard of the Bitcoin time traveller, or spent way too much time considering it. Anyway, none of this went any way to solving the question of whether Bitcoin has a problem with wealth inequality. Is the concentrated distribution of BTC fair? Lingham again veered off into unrealistic hypothetical territory, posing the question, “What is the greatest amount of the world’s wealth that one person should own?” Held countered that it was a good question but not one that he was qualified to answer. However, he claimed to have no issue with one person controlling even 97% of the worlds wealth, as long as that had been earned, through investment of capital. When pushed on ‘what is fair?’ and ‘who or what should decide it?’, Lingham eventually suggested that this was a free market. Held pointed out that this is capitalism. He continued to say that Satoshi had made Bitcoin the most fair launch that you could conceptualise. The initial miners (Satoshi included) spent proof of work energy mining 2-3 million coins which were worth nothing. Those who risked capital on those initial endeavours should be rewarded. Satoshi then decreased his hashrate over time, and hasn’t come back in ten years to touch those initial coins. Held believes that this shows Satoshi’s restraint, and along with his proof that there was no pre-mine, is a way of addressing concerns of the fairness of Bitcoin. Both debaters agreed that the ultimate objective is to improve the human condition, and reduce pain and suffering. Held believes that capitalism is the best way to achieve this, whilst Lingham believes that some form of distribution of wealth serves this purpose better. Well, according to some data, yes. 80% of BTC is held in 2% of wallet addresses. But as many pointed out, a percentage of total wallet addresses is all but meaningless. There can be any number of wallet addresses holding just dust. Perhaps there should be some lower limit applied to rule out these wallets? In actual fact, the number of wallet addresses holding at least 1 billionth of the money supply is at an all-time high. This suggests that the wealth is becoming more distributed. The number of bitcoin addresses holding 1 billionth of the money supply (about 0.018 BTC / $200) is at an all-time high. https://t.co/FOnR0txOad pic.twitter.com/sO7YsWsb84 — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) August 13, 2019  There will always be inequality in the world. Currently, 1% of the world population control 50% of the world’s wealth and rising. But can Bitcoin do any thing to change this? I’m not sure that was ever in its remit.

Currently circulating on social media are charts of CME Group’s Bitcoin futures performance which traditionally impacts on the Bitcoin price. On these charts it shows a probability of BTC/USD soon hitting $8,400.  The theory emerges on the back of fresh volatility in Bitcoin markets, with the largest cryptocurrency falling away from local highs above $12,000 to lose $11,000 support on August 14.  At press time, the pair was trading beneath $10,500, with traders keenly eyeing how support reacts to the threat of Bitcoin returning to four digits.  According to the futures data, however, that likelihood is considerable. Identifying two gaps in the charts since June, Twitter account known as The Cryptomist bet on BTC/USD trading at both $8400 and $11,800 in future. “Do not be mistaken, both will be filled,” the analyst summarized. $Btc 1089 gap almost filled 2 more gaps need to be filled – 11.8k– 8.4k Do not be mistaken, both will be filled. pic.twitter.com/ZtqtZ4WR9C — The Cryptomist (@TheCryptomist) August 13, 2019  The futures gaps mentioned refer to vacuums in markets where trading opened higher than the previous close’s high or lower than the previous low. In the past, Bitcoin has had a habit of ‘filling in’ gaps left in futures performance, giving rise to Cryptomist’s confidence that the same pattern will occur now.  CME’s futures have exerted pressure on Bitcoin before. As Bitcoinist reported, settlement dates have traditionally produced price pressure.  2019 will meanwhile see multiple new futures providers enter the arena, including offerings from crypto businesses themselves in the form of exchange Binance.  Beyond the futures metric, however, commentators appeared broadly ambivalent towards Bitcoin price movements on Wednesday, as many appeared used to fluctuations between $9500 and $12,000.  According to a Twitter survey conducted by trader and analyst Josh Rager, just as many users believed BTC/USD would dip below $10,000 as stay above it.  The fresh dip meanwhile gave extra ammunition to naysayers. Peter Schiff, the gold bug well known for his distrust of cryptocurrency, used news of a brief respite in the US-China trade war to criticize the idea local investors were flocking to Bitcoin. “Now that trade tension with China has eased, the pressure on the yuan is off. Those who bought Bitcoin to speculate on Chinese safe haven buying, which never happened, are taking their chips off the table,” he said on Tuesday.

The offerings, sponsored by VanEck/SolidX, Bitwise and Wilshire Phoenix, all came before the regulator earlier this year.  “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider this proposed rule change,” a summary common to all three filings reads. An ETF refers to a kind of financial instrument for institutional investors to gain exposure to the price of Bitcoin. So far, the SEC has refused to allow an ETF to market over various regulatory concerns, while officials have informally stated they would be open to a Bitcoin or even Ethereum-based product.  The process to get an ETF to market began back in March 2017, when the crypto industry saw its first rejection from the SEC. Since then, proposals have been withdrawn and reformulated several times, with VanEck/SolidX most recently filing again in February.  According to the law, the SEC has a maximum of 240 days from the date of application to give a definitive answer as to whether it can legally operate in the US.  As such, VanEck will find out if it will finally get its product around the regulator on October 18, while Bitwise will be notified five days earlier on October 13.  Wilshire Phoenix, having applied later, will get its next update on whether the process will see a further delay at the end of September.  Reacting to the news, Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset strategist and director at VanEck, appeared positive about the coming months.  “A physical, liquid, insured Bitcoin ETF may serve the public interest. Onwards!” he wrote on Twitter.  The ETF battle has gained its fair share of attention over its two-year history, with commentators generally of the opinion that a go-ahead would significantly increase Bitcoin’s profile.  At the same time, others have voiced concerns, among them Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who last year claimed the whole issue was a distraction within the wider sphere of cryptocurrency’s ascent to ubiquity.  “I think there’s too much emphasis on BTC/ETH/whatever ETFs, and not enough emphasis on making it easier for people to buy $5 to $100 in cryptocurrency via cards at corner stores,” Bitcoinist quoted him as saying.  “The former is better for pumping price, but the latter is much better for actual adoption.” What do you think about the likelihood of a Bitcoin ETF gaining SEC approval?

This could continue for quite some time as one prominent analyst suggests. It might be time to ignore these choppy markets and focus on the bigger picture. Bitcoin is on the slide again during the Asian trading sessioni today. From a touch of support turned resistance at $11,450, BTC turned south and has since declined almost 2% to an intraday low of $11,230 today. Bitcoin is currently sitting on support and a fall through it, which is looking likely, could see it drop back to the next level around $10,800. BTC price 1 hour chart – Tradingview.com Daily volume has dropped considerably, along with volatility. At the moment the volume is down 40% on the week to around $13 billion. Bitcoin itself has dropped 8% over the past seven days and its market capitalization is about to fall below $200 billion again. Bitcoin’s slow retreat this week has resulted in further declines in total crypto market capitalization. Over $4 billion has been dumped since the same time yesterday as market cap drops to $293 billion. Bitcoin dominance is still a shade under 70% according to Tradingview which means the altcoins are getting hammered even harder as has been the case for most of 2019. In times of market chop and consolidation it becomes tougher to execute winning trades. Prominent analyst Murad Mahmudov, who has been quiet on crypto twitter recently, has suggested that there could be steady accumulation during this chop. At first glance this looks like a weak chop for the next week or so, but my intuition tells me there is steady accumulation happening at these levels. Don’t try to outsmart yourself on short timeframes, zoom out & think big. In my view, BTC is going to $100K per orangecoin.

These reportedly follow one of three key attack vectors.  After last week’s UN report summary, the full version reveals the extent and geographical distribution of North Korea’s cyberattacks. According to the South China Morning Post, hackers targeted South Korea the most, with the UN investigating 10 attacks. India suffered three attacks, and Bangladesh and Chile were victims of two attacks each. But individual attacks were reported across the globe, in Africa, Central and South America, the Middle East, South East Asia, and Europe. The United Nations views these attacks as an attempt to skirt sanctions. According to the report, the increasingly sophisticated attacks are ‘low risk but high yield’, often requiring not much more than a laptop and internet connection. There were three main methods in which the North Korean hackers operated: attacks through the Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) system, cryptocurrency thefts from exchanges and users, and “mining of cryptocurrency as a source of funds for a professional branch of the military.” SWIFT attacks were generally carried out “with bank employee computers and infrastructure accessed to send fraudulent messages and destroy evidence.” In Chile, hackers used LinkedIn to ‘headhunt’ an employee of the Chilean interbank network connecting all of the countries ATMs. Cryptocurrency exchanges were repeatedly attacked, with at least four hits on South Korea’s Bithumb. Stolen funds following a 2018 attack “were transferred through at least 5,000 separate transactions and further routed to multiple countries before eventual conversion.” As well as ‘quasi-legitimate’ mining operations, the report investigated ‘crypto-jacking‘, whereby North Korean hackers infect computers with malware. The computers resources are then directed to mine cryptocurrency for the benefit of the attacker. In one instance, malware mining Monero was sending the proceeds to servers at Kim Il-Sung university in Pyong Yang. What do you make of these latest findings?

According to monitoring resource Whale Alert, which publishes details of major cryptocurrency transactions on Twitter, just over 30 BTC known to have come from Bitfinex left its holding wallet on August 12. The move is the second for that portion of the hack, which in total involved 119,756 BTC (now worth $1.35 billion), after it entered the previous wallet as part of a bigger tranche of cash in June this year. Prior to that, the Bitcoin sum had remained dormant since the time of the hack, which occurred in August 2016 and sparked a major law enforcement initiative. At the time, BTC/USD traded at around $650, with the theft sending markets plummeting closer to $580. In February this year, Bitfinex succeeded in reclaiming a further portion of the hacked funds – 27.66 BTC ($312,000) – from the US government following years of detective work. The vast majority, however, remains unaccounted for.  Chief financial officer Giancarlo Devasini said at the time, We will continue to assist law enforcement with their inquiries, and also once again extend an open invitation to the hackers, or anyone harbouring information pertaining to the breach, to make contact in whichever medium they feel most secure with, to finally resolve the situation in a mutually beneficial manner, Bitfinex has yet to comment on the latest developments, while speculation already abounds on social media as to where the stolen bitcoin funds will go next, and whether they will be converted.  The exchange is already facing multiple battles in 2019, likewise involving US authorities. As Bitcoinist reported, the latest issues focus on more quarantined funds worth around $850 million.  The New York Attorney General is currently battling both Bitfinex and its sister company, the issuer of stablecoin Tether, in court over alleged embezzlement, something the defendants have strongly denied.  A judge threw out some of the allegations last month, but the case has not seen a full dismissal and is ongoing.  Worldwide, exchanges continue to grapple with the pitfalls of the industry, with Binance last week fending off accusations a hack had compromised its user data.  Prior to that, the exchange acknowledged the loss of $41 million worth of tokens in a separate incident, refunding users and promising they had learned from the exposed shortcomings.

China, Britain and Venezuela are the prominent examples but now Argentina may be added to that list as their currency and stock markets crumble. Argentina is waking to fears of a full blown financial crisis today as the national currency and stock markets slump. In a surprise outcome to primary elections over the weekend, President Mauricio Macri’s demolition has rattled investors and caused an exodus to begin. According to Bloomberg, the S&P Merval Index plunged 48% in dollar terms which is the second largest one day rout on any of the 94 stock exchanges the outlet has tracked since the 1950s. The fear stems from the likelihood of a protectionist government taking power later this year and unravelling trust that has been built up with international markets. Argentina has billions in foreign currency debts and fears of defaulting are now beginning to develop. The report added that credit-default swaps now show that traders are pricing in a 75% chance that the country will suspend debt payments in the next five years. In addition to the stock market collapse, the Peso plunged over 25% on Monday to a record low of 60 to the dollar. Argentina is no stranger to economic turmoil and worries of a return to times where currency controls, data manipulation, and protectionist policies on trade to protect national industries were commonplace, are growing. In Venezuela the population turned to bitcoin as the currency was crushed but is the same happening now in Argentina? Volume on Localbitcoins has been steadily rising since 2017 but this trend has happened elsewhere. LBC volume ARS – Coin.dance Analyst and trader Alex Krüger pointed out that bitcoin awareness is very low in the South American nation which is heavily hedged to the dollar. As a result the BTC market is very small there, just $220,000 USD last week according to Coin Dance. Krüger added that volume is only growing due to the depreciation of the Peso. One could point at LocalBitcoins’ ever growing volumes. However, volume is only growing in ARS terms due to the depreciation of the peso. Volume has been dropping steadily and registered only 23 bitcoin in total last week. One could point at LocalBitcoins' ever growing volumes.

On August 12, Invector Labs chief scientist, Jesus Rodriguez, took to Hackernoon and made his case as to why he believes Bitcoin remains bullish despite correcting from $13,800. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to struggle to stay above $11,000 and technical analysis suggest the digital asset could drop to $10,800 – $10,600 over the short-term.  According to Rodriguez, the majority of speculation surrounding Bitcoin price has been focused on macroeconomic factors such as the US / China trade-war, global monetary easing and central bank policies that are leading to the devaluation of fiat currencies.  Last week, President Trump introduced additional tariffs on Chinese goods and the Dow Industrial Average reacted by dropping nearly 800 points. At the same time, volatility has increased across major world indices and China placed the cherry on top of this disastrous sundae by devaluing their currency.  Meanwhile, Gold and Bitcoin increased in value as investors viewed the assets as a store-of-value and hedge against volatility.  While these are incredibly relevant factors that are clearly impacting Bitcoin price, Rodriguez suggests that investors take a deeper look beyond the macroeconomic perspective and analyze blockchain data.  Looking closer at blockchain data could uncover some interesting details and patterns that shed light on the recent Bitcoin rally.   According to IntoTheBlock’s blockchain-based data sets, nearly 90% of Bitcoin investors are “in the money”.  There are also nearly one million addresses with positions acquired near Bitcoin’s current price and Rodriguez argues that these investors will help “influence the trading activity in the next few days.”  IntoTheBlock’s Break-Even analysis primarily focuses on realized gains and the indicator shows that Bitcoin’s next strong support/resistance is near $10,400.   Furthermore, as BTC price rose, so did the number of active addresses and this is a sign of growing strength within the Bitcoin network.     Rodriguez also attempted to poke a hole in the default explanation that China’s yuan devaluation led to Asian investors taking shelter in Bitcoin.  Even more interesting is the fact that the majority of ‘new’ Bitcoin investors accumulated the digital asset before the current price rally began.  Essentially Rodriguez is saying that the current macroeconomic factors are reflective of long-term, structural challenges that have long existed in various economics and are just now showing themselves.  This does not mean that macroeconomic challenges are directly responsible for the majority of BTC price action. In fact, macro-economic factors are short-term price indicators for Bitcoin price action and should not be fully relied upon to predict price movement.  Rodriguez advises that investors also incorporate analysis of blockchain data like on-chain activity, network hash-rate, the volume of large institutional and retail transaction, new address origination and the fluctuations in Bitcoin address openings, closing, and transfers at various price points.  By doing this, investors attain a more comprehensive view of the whole market and are likely to make wiser investment decisions.  Do you think the current Bitcoin rally is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors?

Bitcoin price levels hold above $11,000 for now but the low volume could cause this support to break.  On the 4 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see the break-down of the asymmetrical triangle mentioned. Speculation that the triangle was indeed a bullish pennant has now been clearly rejected. A break-down of the rising support line was also broken at the same point around $11,700. Since then price levels have been hovering above $11,000 support, the short-term sentiment will largely be determined by whether $11,000 holds or not. RSI hit oversold flashing a buy signal and has since bounced, heading back for the median 50.0. Volume was rising steadily throughout the build-up to $12,000 and has now started a clear decline. Given that the volume has dropped quite significantly in the last week alone, the price action has managed to hold fairly strong. This could be a sign of weakness from bears. Volume levels will need to pick up within the next few days in order to see any continuation of the short-term bullish trend.  On the 1 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see the clear break-down of both the rising support and asymmetrical triangle. Price levels since dropped to around $11,100 and have begun a small uptrend indicating selling momentum has come to a halt. 200 EMA can be seen moving completely sideways as it touches the 20 SMMA and 50 MA. This is a sign of consolidation happening again ahead of a big move for Bitcoin. There are conflicting bullish and bearish indications as this period of short-term consolidation unfolds. I expected to see bears remain convincingly in control of the market price action after the break-down but this has yet to play out. Bitcoin volume remains low and will be the main indication to look out for to determine where price action could be heading. POC (Point of Control) sitting back at the break-down point around $11,700 sits as the main resistance point. If price levels begin another bullish trend here and surpass the POC mentioned then it’s highly likely price levels will continue to create a new visible range high around $12,400 and above. Adversely, if price levels make a new visible range low breaking down below $11,000 and holding a sensible support zone to look out for is between $9,800 and $10,170. This support zone visible on the 4-hour analysis provided. Do you think BTC will hold $11,000 over the coming days? Please leave your thoughts in the comments below!

Popular crypto-analyst and Blockroots co-founder Josh Rager recently posted a Twitter thread detailing how to accumulate BTC. Rager compares margin trading versus altcoin trading and suggests that “Both of these strategies can be used to accumulate more Bitcoin.”  According to Rager, use of low leverage margin trading is best applied when the crypto-market as a whole is in a downtrend or when BTC is steadily outperforming altcoins. Rager suggested that minimal leverage like 5x to 3x on Kraken can be applied when “Bitcoin pullbacks in a macro uptrend, especially when alts make new lows vs BTC”.  Alternatively, the strategy of “flipping alts” can also be implemented when the leading crypto consolidates and trades sideways for a prolonged period of time.  First, one would need to confirm that Bitcoin is trading within a defined range, then watch various altcoins to determine whether they are finding support. Rager then suggests that “buying at confirmed support with a stop-loss below” is a fantastic way to accumulate BTC on altcoin-to-bitcoin pairings.  Savvy investors will note that altcoins have taken an absolute pummelling since BTC began its parabolic rally from $4,000 to $13,800. Furthermore, as Bitcoin topped out at $13,800 and sharply corrected as low as $9,100, altcoins took another beating and many are now at or even below their 2017 lows.  Throughout the ramp-up to $13,800, Bitcoin dominance rose as high as 70% and currently sits at 68.8%. Therefore, investing in altcoins at this point is extremely risky as they could continue to depreciate if BTC rallies or corrects.  Rager appears to acknowledge this and admits that he prefers to utilize minimal leverage “in this current market until altcoins show to outperform Bitcoin.” The analyst also suggests that simply buying and holding Bitcoin could be the most sensible option for traders who are wary of altcoins and not confident enough to trade with margin.  Hodling BTC has proven to be one of the most effective trading strategies as demonstrated by a fairly blunt tweet by Rhythm last week:   Do you think it is wise to use leverage while trading Bitcoin?

In a note released to investors, the Wall Street bank predicted a short-term bitcoin price target of $13,971. Going by the current market value, this forecast indicates a 25% increase in bitcoin price during the upward push. Su Zhu of Three Arrows Capital posted a tweet on Monday (August 12, 2019) showing a portion of the note from Goldman Sachs. The forecast appears to rely on the “Elliot Wave Theory,” which holds that there is an observable pattern in the price action of assets controlled by herd mentality. What is more surprising: that Goldman Sachs has a bullish target on $BTC, that they have any target at all, or that they use Elliott Wave Theory? I'm personally most surprised they cant be bothered to use a chart that includes weekend price action. pic.twitter.com/ocpq7hr0qv — Su Zhu 🦁 (@zhusu) August 12, 2019  This pattern moves between periods of optimism — uptrends, and pessimism — downtrend. According to the note, if the bitcoin price doesn’t fall below $10,791, there is every likelihood of a push towards the $12,916 and $13,971 price levels. Back in April 2019, Binance Research published a report highlighting the impact of herd mentality on crypto price action. According to the document, the effect was most noticeable during late uptrend and early downtrend phases. Goldman’s analysis doesn’t, however, account for weekend trading as it uses only data from bitcoin futures. A rise to $13,971 would also mean a new 2019 bitcoin price high, bring BTC less than $6,000 outside its mid-December 2017 all-time high.  As previously reported by Bitcoinist, the latter half of summer usually coincides with a downtrend for bitcoin. After breaking above $13,000 in the second week of July, BTC slid all the way down to the mid-$9,000. There has since been a mini recovery beginning at the end of July. This past week in August has seen the bitcoin price achieve its highest weekly closeout of 2019. According to Goldman’s analysis, any pullback after the bitcoin price reaches $13,971 represents another buying opportunity. On the road to almost eclipsing $20,000 in 2017, the bitcoin price action saw no less than eight 30% pullbacks. An excerpt from the note reads: Any such retracement from 12,916-13,971 should be viewed as an opportunity to buy on weakness as long as it doesn’t retrace further than the 9,084 low. Recently, billionaire VC investor Tim Draper doubled down on his $250,000 bitcoin price forecast by 2022 or Q1 2023 at the latest. Draper also remarked that the top-ranked crypto will be a major medium of exchange globally. Do you think bitcoin will set a new 2019 high after the current pullback?

This confirms that such payments are entirely within the law, and clarifies how to deal with them in accounting.  The ruling covers payment of wages or salary (including bonuses) either wholly or in part using cryptocurrency. Payments must be for services performed as employment, and the ruling does not apply to any crypto-assets provided as a ‘share’ under an employee share scheme. The crypto-assets paid should be able to be directly converted to fiat currency via an exchange, and a significant functionality of the asset should be as a currency. When these conditions met, the new tax rules treat payment in cryptocurrency as a normal part of the employee’s salary or wages. As such, they are subject to pay as you earn (PAYE) income tax at the usual rates. This should be deducted by the employer and paid to the inland revenue (in New Zealand dollars). The guide also gives advice and tools for calculations arising from national schemes such as student loan repayments, working families entitlements, and Kiwisaver schemes. The real benefit from this comes if an employee is able to save some of their earnings paid in cryptocurrency. New Zealand does not have Capital Gains Tax. Therefore, any Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency which is held as an investment will not be subject to further tax. This differs from last year’s UK guidelines. In these, tax is applied at source via income tax, then again on disposal through capital gains tax. Crypto-earnings in New Zealand therefore, suffer less of a tax burden if saved. As Bitcoinist has reported, paying employees in Bitcoin is becoming easier than ever, although Peter Schiff believes there is no demand. Further making a mockery of Schiff’s claims, is the groundswell of calls for Bitcoin payments by NFL stars. Some commentators suggest that increasing payment of wages in Bitcoin will spur an increase in retail acceptance of cryptocurrency. This, of course, should lead to more interest in employees wanting to be paid in cryptocurrency, and so on and so on. New Zealand certainly seems to be paving the way with a simple and inclusive taxation system. What do you make of New Zealand’s new crypto-friendly tax laws? Add your thoughts below!

While gains for BTC investors have been consistent, altcoins have languished and so far failed to copy Bitcoin’s success.  Bitcoin’s overall market cap share is among the highest it has been in over two years, challenging 70% of the $296 billion total.  Despite Bitcoin remaining in its top 2% historical price range, exchanges have faced various hurdles in recent weeks alone.  Binance fended off rumors of a security compromise last week, which impacted severely on the price of its native token, Binance Coin. BitMEX remains under investigation by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), over concerns US traders were circumventing blocking measures to trade on the platform.  The company’s CEO, Arthur Hayes, has meanwhile gone to live in an unspecified remote location until September, according to his Twitter account.  More broadly, the exchange sector is subject to fluctuations as a result of regulatory upheaval. Currently, India is in focus, due to plans to ban cryptocurrency interaction altogether for citizens. At the same time, Japan is licensing a steady stream of new actors, while Binance is preparing to launch a dedicated US version of its platform.  In July, CEO Changpeng Zhao (known as CZ) said that a hypothetical US ban on cryptocurrency would fail to kill the industry.

The move dropped BTC back to support, keeping it range-bound, but the weekly candle close has been the best since early 2018. Markets have remained flat following bitcoin’s $600 dump on Saturday. The plunge took BTC back down to $11,200 before it started trading sideways. Sunday saw another dump as the digital asset dropped down to $11,090 but bounced back from there pretty quickly. Since then, BTC returned to $11,590 but has been falling back during the Asian trading session following a death cross on the hourly chart. At the time of writing bitcoin was trading just below support at 00. BTC prices 1-hour chart – Tradingview.com Bitcoin gains since its big pump last Monday have been eroded as the week has progressed. However, this did not prevent a bullish weekly candle closing just above $11,500 according to Tradingview.

It is up marginally on the day, trading at $213 but further losses are likely if the longer-term downtrend continues.

Now two visionaries are joining forces. In effect, Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk announced his support for Bitcoin-friendly Andrew Yang’s run for U.S. president in 2020.  On August 10, 2019, while hosting the podcast Hard Core History, American political commentator and podcaster, Dan Carlin, commented on Yang’s leadership qualities. In response to those comments, Musk hastened to broadcast a Tweet announcing his support for Yang.  Yang is a Democratic candidate and a proponent of a universal basic income. He accepts campaign donations in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and any other crypto asset complying with the ERC20 standard, as well as Venmo payments. Indeed, to finance Yang’s campaign, super PAC (political action committee) Humanity Forward Fund has joined forces with Opennode to raise unlimited funds from individuals as well as corporations. Opennode is a fast, secure payment platform, which facilitates payments in Bitcoin. Most notably, Humanity Forward Fund, through the Opennode platform, is accepting campaign donations exclusively in Bitcoin for 21 days, from July 25, 2019, to August 14, 2019.  The Humanity Forward Fund proclaims to be: – Pro Bitcoin – Pro Innovation – Pro Financial Sovereignty Yang has already qualified for debate No. 3, scheduled for September 12, 2019. He must still debate eight other candidates: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar. In addition to being pro-Bitcoin, Yang brings innovative ideas to the debate. Most outstanding is his universal basic income proposal, which his campaign website describes as follows: Andrew would implement the Freedom Dividend, a universal basic income of $1,000/month, $12,000 a year, for every American adult over the age of 18. This is independent of one’s work status or any other factor. As Bitcoinist recently reported, Musk and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos are planning to launch thousands of satellites into space. The purpose of this project, according to Bezos, is to provide Internet access to millions of people. And, let’s not forget, Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet. Moreover, billionaire Elon Musk thinks, “Bitcoin structure is brilliant.” So, the endorsement of Yang’s candidature by a visionary such as Musk will most likely help to increase Bitcoin’s rate of adoption.

So how is Bitcoin doing on its path to global domination? Bitcoin price started the week on a flyer, jumping 10% on Monday, and propelling it back towards the $12,000 mark. Year-to-date, this meant that bitcoin had outperformed stocks by a factor of ten. Further price increases on Tuesday pushed us back over $12k, albeit only briefly before a pullback to Monday’s levels. Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), got bullish, tweeting ‘Don’t bet against Bitcoin’, prompting one Bitcoin whale to do just that. The whale offered to personally send CZ 10BTC if price didn’t drop back below $8k in August. Bearishness aside, support held at $11,200 and BTC bounced back to trade at around $11.6k. Wednesday saw bitcoin poke its head even more briefly above the $12k level, and price continued to flirt with but not surpass this value on Thursday. Some believed that the current rally was running out of steam, although others were still eyeing $12,400. If the price could just hold until the end of the week it would be the highest weekly close of 2019… Sadly, a crash on Saturday has seen us trading around the $11.3k level ever since. Not the end to the week that we had hoped for, but still a healthy jump up from last week. And Tim Draper says that we will still be at $250k by the start of 2023, so long-term HODLers can rest easy. A number of high-profile crypto-court-proceedings have seen movement this week. Must be something in the air. Canadian instant-messaging company Kik, kicked (sorry) back against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with a 130-page document refuting its allegations. Kik strongly implied that the SEC action against its 2017 ICO was just a publicity stunt. Of course, the SEC isn’t the only entity gaining publicity through the ongoing litigation. A U.S. judge ruled that Coinbase must face negligence charges over its bodged launch of Bitcoin Cash trading. But whilst BCash buyers were given the green light to proceed with legal action, sellers had their claims dismissed. To be fair, ‘we want compensation because we missed the opportunity to seller BCH at artificially high prices’, was unlikely to garner much sympathy. Finally, the end of the week gave us the first glimpse of Peter McCormack’s defense against Craig Wright‘s libel action. The essence was that calling Wright’s claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto fraudulent could not harm his reputation, as his reputation is already awful. Oh, and arrests at Goldman Sachs over money laundering, made a mockery of U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin’s assertion that cash is not used for such illegal activities. July saw BitMEX deliver the worst month in its history, as over half a billion dollars left the platform. The Bitcoin SV blockchain temporarily split into three after a massive 210MB block was mined on the network. Lightning Network almost doubled its node count and capacity in the first half of 2019. The United Nations claimed that North Korea has accumulated $2 billion of cryptocurrency to fund weapons programs. Binance issued a statement to deny that it had lost customer information in a hack on KYC data. Meanwhile, the hackers who stole more than 7,000 BTC from the exchange back in May, were reportedly trying to launder the coins through a mixer. And Blockstream announced two new bitcoin mining services with an eye on improving decentralization in the field. Chinese bitcoiners have found the perfect present for their version of Valentine’s Day. The number 520 in Chinese is pronounced similarly to ‘I love you’, so crypto whales have been sending loved ones a symbolic 520 BTC. Because nothing says ‘I love you’ more than $6.1 million.

Some analysts foresee a new all-time high for BTC on the back of one of these events. According to a report in the Independent, a no-deal Brexit could send bitcoin soaring. The UK has been in a stalemate with European lawmakers over its departure from the union for almost three years now. This economic uncertainty has caused the GBP to slump to its lowest levels in over a decade. With EU bureaucrats standing fast and not willing to negotiate, a no-deal or ‘hard’ Brexit is looming on October 31. CEO of blockchain firm CommerceBlock, Nicholas Gregory, commented that this could send bitcoin to a new all-time high this year. Bitcoin has rediscovered its mojo this year with multiple mini surges, but a no-deal Brexit could see a massive and unprecedented breakout. Not only will a no-deal departure from the EU create turmoil and volatility across two major fiat currencies, it will also trigger an identity crisis for the global system as the contingency and vulnerability of major global fiat currencies is laid bare. The ‘safe haven’ argument has been increasingly applied to bitcoin in recent months as global economies and their fiat currencies come under pressure from political and financial tensions. Just like gold, BTC is now viewed as a store of value free from state meddling or global politics. Bloomberg noted that bitcoin’s price correlation with gold has doubled over the past three months. Analyst at trading platform eToro, Simon Peters, noted that gold has traditionally been the go-to safe haven asset, adding; Yet bitcoin also seems to have served a similar purpose. Given that Chinese investors make up a large proportion of crypto investors, there’s a strong possibility some are backing bitcoin’s chances against the yuan. The pressure on Britain and its new prime minister, Boris Johnson, is mounting. He has maintained that the UK will exit the EU on that date with or without a deal. Following a majority vote in a referendum in June 2016, Britain has been in a state of economic uncertainty as inept politicians argued over their own agendas with no clear path forward. Gregory added that this would cause bitcoin’s place in the global economy to shift. Come 2020, we expect an increasingly populist and politically unstable world to cement the safe haven status of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more generally. And if central banks revert to ramping up the money printing all over again, the case for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin whose supply is capped will be further reinforced. Each time a central bank increases the money supply, it’s another nail in the coffin of fiat. This may be closer to the truth since Britain is hardly a center for bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption; very few of its 66 million people even know what it is. Nonetheless, the wider implications of Brexit and financial uncertainty regarding fiat could certainly increase demand for BTC and digital assets which are immune from government or central bank manipulation. Will Brexit have an impact on bitcoin prices? Add your thoughts below. ","['bitcoin', 'Brexit', 'Britain', 'eu', 'fiat', 'UK']"

Wright sued McCormack for libel over tweets suggesting that he wasn’t really Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. McCormack’s defence basically states that Wright’s suit is a cynical waste of the court’s time.  The legal notice to Wright’s lawyers is mired in legalese, but still manages to be quite an entertaining read. It states that the contention that Wright has or could suffer serious harm to his reputation is fanciful. The allegation that he fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, is purely the result of his own actions. In repeatedly publicly promising and conspicuously failing to provide proof to the contrary, he has built himself a negative reputation. …within the bitcoin and cryptocurrency sector in particular, the allegation of lying is synonymous with your client and he has no reputation in that respect which can be damaged. The letter goes on to say that there is a way for Wright to get exactly what he says he has always wanted. McCormack will make a public statement withdrawing his allegations that Wright’s claim to be Satoshi is fraudulent. He will also walk away from the proceedings without any contribution to his legal costs so far incurred. The kicker? The way for Wright to achieve this is to voluntarily provide the proof, within 21 days, that he and Calvin Ayre say they have. They have said that they intend to provide this proof during the proceedings anyway, and providing them voluntarily now would “avoid the wholly unnecessary costs and delay of litigation.” However, Ayre tweeted in April that they were “just waiting for a volunteer to bankrupt themselves trying to prove a negative and then letting Craig show the proof.” McCormack’s lawyer points out that: It would obviously be highly unattractive for a claimant to seek to pursue a libel claim merely in order to ‘bankrupt’ the defendant… Moreover, that cynical posturing underscores the futility of pursuing the claim when the claimant claims he can readily dispose of the issue of truth. Failing Wright’s agreement to voluntarily provide the satisfactory and independently verifiable proof that he is Satoshi, McCormack will apply for the case to be struck out. There were also questions raised as to what connections Wright had to the ‘plaintiff friendly’ jurisdiction of the UK. In his Particulars of Claim he says that he is ‘based’ and ‘domiciled’ in England, but gives a different address to the one he has provided in his other ongoing legal battle in Florida. This is the line of defence used by Roger Ver, who had Wright’s defamation case against him struck down last week on these grounds. Interestingly, McCormack only got into this legal argument after openly inviting Wright to sue him. Wright had previously been targeting community member Hodlonaut, known for starting the Lightning Network Torch. This caused many to react, including Binance CEO, CZ, who delisted Wright’s Bitcoin SV form the Binance exchange. What do think of these latest developments?

Now, all could face prison sentences of up to ten years if found guilty. The release confirms: “Custodial sentences and criminal fines will be sought against the accused… given the severity of the scheme to defraud and fraudulent misappropriation of billions in bond proceeds, the lengthy period over which the offenses were planned and executed, the number of Goldman Sachs subsidiaries, officers and employees involved and the relative value of the fees and commissions paid to Goldman Sachs for their multiple roles played in arranging, structuring, underwriting and selling the bonds.” The charges follow on from those Malaysia brought against two other Goldman figures in December last year, also in connection with 1MDB. In January, chief executive David Solomon issued a public apology for the role of, Tim Leissner, one of the participants in the scandal.  “It’s very clear that the people of Malaysia were defrauded by many individuals including the highest members of the prior government,” he said at the time.  The latest events did not go unnoticed in Bitcoin circles, with commentators noting the irony of Goldman’s downfall just weeks after US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed the dollar did not play a role in “nefarious” financial activities. “I don’t think that’s accurate at all, that cash is laundered all the time. We have the strongest AML system in the world,” he told CNBC in an interview. On the topic of Bitcoin, also covered in the same exchange, Mnuchin had little to say, despite previous comments in which he corroborated the opinion of President Donald Trump that it is “based on thin air.” “I don’t think [money laundering] has been successfully done with cash. I’ll push back on that,” he continued.  “We’re going to make sure bitcoin doesn’t become the equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts, which were obviously a real risk to the financial system.”  As Bitcoinist reported, Goldman is far from alone among major banks in becoming mired in money laundering scandals. While Gnodde publicly stating his distrust of Bitcoin during its rise to $20,000 in 2017, just months later, Dutch lender Rabobank issued strongly-worded remarks about Bitcoin’s “compliance risks,” only to receive a $369 million fine for money laundering.

Question is…is his lack of diversification a bad thing? Earlier this week, Anthony Pompliano participated in a CNBC Squawk Box panel which discussed macro-economics and its impact on Bitcoin price action. One panelist asked Pompliano what percentage of his net worth was invested in Bitcoin and Pompliano resolutely said 50%.  Panelist Kevin Oleary, a well-known Canadian businessman, swiftly pounced on Pomp and administered a verbal beating, along with a quick lesson in the economics of investing.  O’Leary said: That’s crazy, I forbid that, that’s insane, that breaches everything about diversification investing!”  O’Leary then rattled off a list of top-10 altcoins, pointing out their significant losses since 2017, then asked Pompliano, “If this is really such a great idea, when is there only one Vegas game working?”  Pompliano did his best to explain why institutional and retail investors should make an allocation for Bitcoin as it is a scarce asset that is non-correlated to traditional markets, and is also a hedge against macroeconomic instability. While traditional economists, financial advisors, and market analysts are likely to agree with O’Leary’s scolding of Pompliano, a cryptocurrency analyst from Twitter swiftly came to Pompliano’s defense.  @RhythmTrader pointed out that despite a 200%+ gain from Bitcoin, 60% of Bitcoin hasn’t moved for more than a year.  This statement aligns with recent data released from CoinMetrics which also showed that Bitcoin’s ‘untouched supply’ had risen to a new high of 21.6%.  The report also observed an uptick in the origination of new Bitcoin addresses. RhythmTrader then asked, “if doubling their wealth isn’t enough to part them with their Bitcoin…then what is?” Alistair Milne also chimed in and tweeted that while it may seem absolutely crazy to invest 50% of one’s net worth into Bitcoin “anyone who “HODL’d since 2015” has seen 60x returns. According to Milne, “it would have only taken a 1% allocation” to bank at least a 50% return.   Of course, investors should carry out due diligence prior to investing in any asset, especially ones that are known for their volatility. Also, while investors are encouraged to diversify their portfolios, it should be noted that Bitcoin is not a stock.  It has no need to generate revenue, it doesn’t answer to a board of ‘shareholders’, it is not controlled by any centralized entity. Putting all one’s eggs in one basket is risky but RhythmTrader left his followers with this:  Do you think it is wise for Anthony Pompliano to keep 50% of his net worth in Bitcoin?

He added that the only people who lost money in the bitcoin market are the ones who exited during downtrends. On the other hand, the ones who kept holding the cryptocurrency regardless of bias pressure, made the maximum profits. Green shows where buying bitcoin has been profitable | Image Credits: Rhythm Trader The revelation came amidst an ongoing discussion about whether or not bitcoin is an ideal store of value asset. Those who support the narrative believe bitcoin is as much a safe haven asset as gold is, i.e., it exhibits a similar scarcity as the precious metal, however excels when it comes to storing and transacting it without permission. Those who are against the narrative believe bitcoin’s underlying price volatility makes it a poor store of value asset. Between the two narratives are traders who treat bitcoin as a pure speculative vehicle. Their day job is to make money off the cryptocurrency’s intraday price fluctuations. If they are whales, they are able to move the market exponentially in either direction. If they are regular investors, they merely tail the bias until it stops making a profit for them.

With the store of value narrative becoming more popular, and thanks to the gloomy macroeconomic outlook that is sending investors searching for non-correlated assets for hedging, bitcoin is looking promising to bring more speculators to its market. Famous cryptocurrency analyst Tony Vays believes bitcoin has enough use-cases to impress an outsider. Bitcoin might be the greatest store of value in the history of the world. Yes, it’s volatile — as it’s only been useful for about seven years — but its ‘un-confiscability’ property is unmatched. That is its true store of value, as gold is confiscatable and all other assets even easier. Supporters also cite Gold for its volatility in the earlier years as a store of value asset. After former US President Richard Nixon switched from the Gold standard to the US dollar standard in 1971, it unhooked the scarce metal from its stability for years.  The comparison puts bitcoin in the category of the potential store of value assets. If the narrative develops any further, the investors under bitcoin’s roof might turn into long-term holders. Now that people know that holders have made reasonable profits, the narrative appears to be developing already. Are you a bitcoin holder or trader?

On the charts we can now see a bullish pennant has formed which could be foreshadowing an imminent breakout to the next resistance above at $12,400.  On the 1 hour chart for XBT/USD we can see a bullish symmetrical triangle has formed. This is also known as a bullish pennant and has formed as a result of the recent breakout and move to the upside mentioned in my previous analysis on Bitcoin. RSI has moved down below the median at 50.00 whilst price levels have held strong which shows consolidation is taking place. The $11,700 level, which had been a strong resistance over the last 2 weeks, is now providing solid support. Descending volume is another characteristic of a bull pennant, not to mention POC (Point of Control) trading directly at market price. This is a very clear indication of consolidation below the key level of $12,400. If bitcoin price levels do decide to break-down, don’t panic, there’s still a good chance that the $11,000 psychological support should cause price levels to bounce. This effectively shakes out weak hands before a test of the key resistance above at $12,400. 200 EMA also acting as a last chance resort support around $11,250. On the 4 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see a bullish MA cross appeared on August 6 after the 50 MA and 200 EMA bullishly converged. This in conjunction with a sharp up-trend resulting from a clear breakout of the larger asymmetrical triangle, is a clear sign that bitcoin bulls are currently in control. Volume has started to pick up in the last few days which is really important to note. If volume had remained at the levels seen throughout the end of July and first few days of August, the short-term bullish trend would likely have been unsustainable.

According to a report by blockchain forensics firm Clain, the hackers who stole more than 7,000 BTC from Binance are trying to use Chipmixer to funnel their crypto loot. An excerpt from the report reads: We detected an extensive pool of Chipmixer’s addresses in the course of the previous investigations and can confidently maintain that at least 4836 BTC of the hacker’s monies was laundered through Chipmixer.

Instead, the forensics firm says the Binance hackers are trying to completely obfuscate the ‘BTC trail.’ Crypto tumblers (or mixers) like Chipmixer allow users to obscure the link between the sending and receiving addresses for bitcoin transactions. Such services insert payments from A to B into a pool of other payments to hide transaction trails. For Clain, the activities of the hackers on the service amounts to a bombardment of Chipmixer. The firm says the bitcoin tumbler has never had to handle such a large number of transactions at a given time. According to Clain, the Binance hackers are trying to fly under the radar by aggregating clusters of 10 BTC transactions. So far, Clain says it has identified 150 of these clusters. Concerning the continued tracking of the situation, the Clain report reads: As regards to remaining amounts, we think the hacker is yet to merge them, so once he attempts to do it, we will be able to effectively spot these transactions and recognize the same pattern. Back in July 2019, Bitcoinist reported that the hackers had moved about 707 BTC, valued at over $8 million at the time. The transfer coincided with a bitcoin price surge that took BTC above $12,000. In another development, Clain says its investigation into the laundering of the loot from the Binance bitcoin hack has led to revelations about another crypto theft from a different bitcoin exchange. The blockchain forensics firm says it found 1,032 BTC that was part of the mid-July BitPoint hack. Binance is currently dealing with another security breach issue, this time concerning customer data. The bitcoin exchange giant is denying claims from a suspected blackmailer over an alleged KYC leak. Will the hackers be able to successfully cash out their loot from the Binance bitcoin hack?

Blockstream Mining is a co-location and hosting service housed in two huge new data-centers, while Blockstream Pool is the world’s first mining pool to use the BetterHash protocol. The Blockstream Mining product is based around two massive data-centers in Quebec and the U.S. state of Georgia. Blockstream help with delivery logistics, installation, running, and maintenance of clients’ mining equipment. However, the clients control the devices remotely via a control panel giving real-time analytics. The two data centers account for a combined 300 megawatts of electricity supply. If fully populated with the latest mining ASICs it could provide 7.5% of the total hash power of the Bitcoin network. The service is currently aimed at enterprise and institutional clients, but will in future open up to small businesses and individuals, further improving decentralization. Blockstream started its mining operations in 2017, concerned that certain mining rig manufacturers were becoming a centralized force. This latest expansion of the service aims to counter this by providing a turnkey solution for co-location and hosting services. Blockstream’s other prong in its quest for improved decentralization of Bitcoin mining is Blockstream Pool. This is claimed to be the world’s first Bitcoin mining pool which utilizes the BetterHash protocol. The BetterHash protocol allows individual miners in the pool to determine which transactions to include into newly mined blocks. In the majority of mining pools, the pool operator controls which transactions get included. This can increase the risk of potential network attacks, for example, if the operator of a large pool decides to block certain transactions. Handing this power back to the miners means that the Bitcoin network becomes more decentralized and censorship-resistant. Some may question whether the Blockstream Mining service is promoting less decentralization rather than more. However, Blockstream CSO Samson Mow had this to say: If anything, Blockstream Mining serves to decentralize the Bitcoin mining ecosystem… We’re self-mining with just a small portion of our available power, with the rest allocated to customers, and we have plans to make the hosting service available to smaller miners that otherwise would not be able to mine effectively. Combined with the enhanced decentralization brought about through the BetterHash protocol, Blockstream certainly intends to do its bit for decentralization. Outside of mining, Blockstream is also working hard to improve the Bitcoin network for everyone through its Liquid sidechain project. Will Blockstream be successful in decentralizing Bitcoin mining?

Now, a modality posed to gain momentum is to incentivize customers through loyalty programs that give bitcoins for their purchases online.  Merchants design marketing strategies such as loyalty programs to encourage customers to continue purchasing their products and services.  Although loyalty programs are attractive, they have a flaw. Harry Alford points out in his Medium article titled “How Crypto Can Turn The World Into Investors,” that some consumers are not motivated to redeem the points they accumulate. For example, according to marketing firm Bond Brand Loyalty, customers neglect to claim loyalty points worth $100 billion. Bond Brand Loyalty concludes, Redeemers are twice as satisfied with loyalty programs as non-redeemers, yet more than one-fifth of program members have never redeemed. Results show that the redemption experience—the anticipation of reward, as well as ease of redemption—is more important than the actual reward. According to Alford, Bitcoin could be the solution. Integrating BTC into loyalty programs could enhance the consumer experience while increasing Bitcoin’s rate of adoption. As Alford puts it, “Micro-investing into digital assets could very well be the new shopping experience.” New techniques and technologies are continuously improving Bitcoin’s capabilities as a medium of payment. Indeed, Bitcoin engineers and developers are often making improvements to solve critical issues such as transaction costs and scalability. For example, innovations such as Lightning Network, SegWit, and Atomic Multi-Path Payments over Lightning are already addressing these issues. Most recently, in July 2018, Blockstream announced the release of c-lightning version 0.7.1, which promises several technical innovations to make the Lightning Network even faster and more efficient. The bitcoins and rewards site Lolli is already ahead of the curve. Through its BTC-based loyalty program, Lolli may have found the answer to attract and retain customers. Lolli’s loyalty program offers customers opportunities to earn up to 30% back in Bitcoin rewards. In fact, the Lolli website announces, “Earn free bitcoin when you shop online.” Fold App is also another example of a company that offers ‘Sats-back’ on certain purchases made with supporting vendors, including Starbucks and Amazon.

The group has also targeted cryptocurrencies, including at least one case in which there was a connection between cryptocurrency and an online video gaming platform. In October 2018, the group compiled an instance of XMRig, a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool, demonstrating a continued interest in cryptocurrency.

According to a report by Coin Metrics, 318 addresses own 80% of the current total supply of the Tether stablecoin. Bloomberg quoting excerpts from the Coin Metrics study reported that these addresses own at least $1 million in USDT. The report also revealed that major exchanges like Binance and Bittrex are among the USDT whales. Tether accounts for a significant portion of cryptocurrency trades across several platforms in the market. Other major players include high-volume crypto traders in China. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Tether is finding significant utility in China for facilitating trade with Russia. Chinese traders are reportedly buying between $10 million to $30 million worth of Tether on a daily basis. Whales owning significant portions of total crypto supply isn’t in itself a novel occurrence. However, the extent of the whale ownership centralization in USDT might raise some alarms. Taking bitcoin, for example, whale wallets own only 20% of the total BTC supply. Also, unlike Tether, this whale share for BTC is spread out over more than 20,000 addresses holding $1 million or more in bitcoin. With the continued debate over the role USDT plays in bitcoin price discovery, the revelation of massive USDT ownership centralization is sure to reignite discussions of whether a few market participants manipulate BTC price. Speaking to Bloomberg, John Griffin of the University of Texas, said: The concentration of Tether suggests that control of Tether is in the hands of a few central players who can swing Bitcoin prices, and have a vested interest in doing so. It also suggests that many exchange players have a vested interest in keeping the Tether game going. Per a previous Bitcoinist report, some commentators believe Tether issuance to be the driving force behind bitcoin price gains. The narrative suggests that each large USDT printing exercise signals significant moves by whales — a precursor to a major price rally for bitcoin. However, critics of the Tether manipulation angle argue that USDT market cap increase is nowhere near enough to cause the growth in the crypto market capitalization. Currently, Bitfinex and Tether are involved in a legal imbroglio with the New York Attorney General (NYAG). As reported by Bitcoinist, the court recently postponed deliberation on the matter.

That’s pretty impressive for a 10-year-old upstart, created from an anonymously published 9-page whitepaper. Bitcoin’s mathematically limited supply has seen it being increasingly used as a store of value and an associated climb in price. In terms of market cap, bitcoin now beats the national currencies of Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and South Korea. At time of press, the value of all the bitcoins ever created was over $0.21 trillion. That is just short of the global supply of Russian rubles. So who’s next? After all, Bitcoin is the hardest money ever created, so it stands to reason there are some more scalps in its sights. Well, after Russia is despatched, the bitcoin market cap will have to double to topple the next largest supply of India. There is currently over $0.4 trillion worth of rupees in circulation. Another similar increase would be required to overtake Switzerland ($0.6 trillion), and the same again to become more valuable than the current supply of silver ($0.8 trillion). At this point, the United Kingdom would also have fallen by the wayside, with around $0.7 trillion worth of sterling in circulation. After that, it will probably be time to take a breather. Bitcoin will be the 6th largest money supply, and the price will be pushing $50k… and getting in the top five will take a monumental push. It’s a considerable further jump up to the current currency supply of the United States ($3.3 trillion) and Eurozone ($3.6 trillion). Even then we still have China ($4.6 trillion) and Japan ($4.9 trillion) to surpass before we can focus on the biggest prize. Gold! The stuff of Peter Schiff‘s dreams, and by far the largest supply of base money, with an estimated $8.4 trillion worth. Whilst this may seem like some pie in the sky fantasy, models like stock-to-flow do seem to suggest that bitcoin’s reducing supply of new coins due to reward halving events, could propel the market cap to $100 trillion after 2028. Arguably not. The biggest factor feeding market cap in the short term is simply bitcoin price. So at the height of 2017’s crypto-frenzy, bitcoin was already the 10th largest money. Plus, this doesn’t really reflect circulating supply, as many of the existing coins are forever lost or unusable. But that does also increase their rarity, which should eventually lead to further price increases. Still, it’s a nice thing to reflect on the number of people who have put their faith in “a bank with no CEO, office or marketing department.” As Rhythm suggests, “it should absolutely blow your mind.” Bitcoin is now the 11th largest money in the world, and it obtained this with only a nine-page paper created anonymously fueled by a grassroots movement. Millions of people have choosen a bank with no CEO, office or marketing department and it should absolutely blow your mind. pic.twitter.com/I8Mgv2fRjJ — Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) August 7, 2019  Do you think bitcoin will be the one true global currency?

Adding his weight to the current discussion on Bitcoin’s utility versus gold, Dan McArdle, co-founder of analytics firm Messari, said the cryptocurrency could copy the precious metal’s behavior in the coming years. Specifically, he said in social media comments on August 7, BTC/USD might repeat what gold did after the 2008 financial crisis. “I would not be surprised if BTC performs like gold did 2008-2011,” he wrote.  Initial spike on fears of crises, big fall as liquidity crises actually sets in, followed by [an] even bigger rise as real debt/sovereign/currency fears take hold. McArdle referenced fresh comments on gold by Raoul Pal, the serial asset manager who recently presented a buoyant outlook for both bitcoin and gold on the Stephan Livera podcast. On the topic of gold’s current return to form in line with Bitcoin, he said markets were preparing for the dollar’s own winning streak to come to an abrupt end. The question, he argued, was when it would happen. “Gold is rightly doing its job, sniffing out a BIG problem and is exploding higher, outperforming even the super strong dollar as gold begins to price in an end game of an eventual MASSIVE readjustment of the dollar (in 12 months? 18 months?),” he tweeted.  As Bitcoinist reported, Bitcoin price bull runs since April have reignited a fierce debate about its potential long-term use as a gold-like safe haven asset. More and more figures continue to go on record to say a shift into Bitcoin for investors looking for a hedge against inflation is happening, borne from a need to exit the Chinese yuan in particular. Those included Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, as well as multiple consultancy executives this week. Others remain opposed, among them well-known gold bugs such as Peter Schiff, who has doubled down on his opinion that gold is ultimately far better as an investment than cryptocurrency.  “The Chinese aren’t buying Bitcoin as a safe haven. Speculators are buying, betting that the Chinese will buy it as a safe haven!” he claimed this week in the latest of a series of suspicions regarding current pro-Bitcoin narratives. Schiff spent an hour arguing over the issue with Bitcoin proponent Anthony Pompliano in a CNBC debate last week.  What do you think about Messari’s outlook for Bitcoin?

Bearish signs start have started to show as market price trades below a key resistance level at $12,400.  On the 2 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see the ascending channel formed as a result of the recent breakout taking price levels up to a key resistance level at $12,400. It’s likely that if BTC can surpass this resistance level price levels will attempt to break the yearly high around $14,000. Volume levels have been rising steadily throughout this newly formed uptrend which is a sign of strength. POC (Point of Control) sits at $11,700 just above the current market price at $11,650. This tells us that there’s a lot of buyers and sellers at this level, typically short-term trends with such growth volume start to fade out over time but this doesn’t appear to be the case. 50 MA running along with the support of the ascending triangle around $11,450 acts as the last chance support to determine whether BTC will break down out of this ascending channel. RSI sits neutral around 50.00 despite price levels still well within the sharp uptrend. This could mean we’re very close to a break-down or bulls could be re-fuelling. We’ll begin to have more clarity on this over the coming days. On the 30 minute chart for XBT/USD, we can see Bitcoin is unfolding around the current market price. Each green spike is met shortly after with a larger red spike which could be manipulation. This allows whales to essentially sell their positions back to each-other to fuel another bullish run as price levels trade just below the key breakout point at $12,400. Adversely this could mean bulls strength is weakening and failing to gain any traction close to this key level mentioned. On the technical analysis, you’ll see two points marked. This is a visible lower high and failure to gain essentially meaning bullish momentum isn’t strong enough to result in a higher market price yet. 200 EMA at $11,350 is now acting as the visible range support. We know if price levels break down below the 200 EMA further downside is likely. Please refer back to my pullback target mentioned in a previous BTC analysis for direction if this happens.

The South Korean Ministry of SMEs and Startups in 2018 designated 1 trillion KRW for growing their blockchain technology industry as part of a “Growth Through Innovation” plan. But the place is running dry of companies since they cannot launch private assets atop the ledgers they are creating. Those assets are what the world otherwise called native cryptocurrencies, which, according to local civil and commercial laws, remain banned in South Korea. Korea IT Times reported this Wednesday that the newly announced ‘blockchain-regulation free’ city of Busan is likely to be ‘ineffective’ as a result of the country’s existing strict regulations around cryptocurrencies and ICO’s. According to Korea IT Times, a blockchain startup named OkayCoin Core had its screening rejected due to regulatory restrictions. The firm got excluded by a selection committee despite having nothing to do with decentralized or initial-coin-offering assets. It just created asset-backed securities – by merely combining cryptography with tokenization – that would flow seamlessly across wallets while their transactions getting stored automatically atop a ledger. OkayCoin eventually fell short when it came to respecting the Korean Financial Services Commission’s anti-crypto directive. One promising company down, as a result. The Busan Metropolitan Government, which has put its weight behind the blockchain exclusive zone, confirmed OkayCoin is their project, which was likely to begin by the end of this year. On regulatory roadblocks, the body commented that they would review the proposals about cryptocurrencies offered by relevant ministries, admitting that they have no authority to change the mind of anti-crypto lawmakers and regulators. Excerpts: Busan should review the proposals when the relevant ministries give opinions on the special district participation such as acceptance or conditional acceptance. If the Korean Financial Services Commission keeps an unacceptable position for ‘the special regulation-free on cryptocurrency, the Ministry of SMEs and Startups cannot change it to acceptance. The Busan blockchain-regulation free zone has been created to allow for work to be done in four key areas: logistics, tourism, public safety, and finance. Around 13 companies applied to open offices in the area, given its low cost and tax requirements. One of the firms, the Busan Bank, had even launched a cryptography-enabled currency to boost circulation atop its private blockchain. But it changed the term ‘cryptocurrency’ to ‘crypto voucher’ following the Korean Financial Services Commission’s ban on launching digital assets. Busan Bank is among the only selected companies for the Busan Blockchain Special Zone, listed alongside BiPi & Solution, Busan Techno Park (Food & Water), Hyundai Pay, Korea Tour Pass (Tourism), Coinplug, Sarada (public safety). The South Korean government wants to spend $1 trillion on the blockchain development in the coming years.

In a statement issued August 6, the major cryptocurrency exchange said it was investigating the claims, which revolve around a hacker demanding 300 BTC in return for withholding traders’ personal data, including passports.  The threats, which Binance now acknowledge are genuine, came via a Telegram group which has amassed over 10,000 members.  In the statement, Binance explained that the alleged data set showed “inconsistencies” compared to genuine user information, such as a lack of an internal watermark. It thus remains unknown as to whether any of the documents are genuine or related to Binance. “We are still investigating this case for legitimacy and relevancy. After refusing to cooperate and continuing with his extortion, this individual has begun distributing the data to the public and to media outlets,” the statement warns. “…At the present time, no evidence has been supplied that indicates any KYC images have been obtained from Binance, as these images do not contain the digital watermark imprinted by our system. With that said, our security team is hard at work pursuing all possible leads in an attempt to identify the source of these images.” On social media, CEO Changpeng Zhao (known as ‘CZ’) requested users not share the address of the Telegram group or spread misinformation based on nonofficial sources. “Don’t fall into the ‘KYC leak’ FUD.

In all of the trade war noise, one factor that has been missed is the inversion of the yield curve in U.S. Treasury markets. This creates added risks, as an inverted yield curve has accurately predicted the last eight U.S. recessions (since 1960). Domestic economic figures in the U.S. have been largely stable, as annualized GDP figures have risen by 3.1% and the unemployment rate is currently holding at a 50-year low of 3.7%. However, recent volatility in the bond market suggests that investors are concerned about near-term risks that have the capability of damaging the outlook for both businesses and consumers. For market traders, the real questions deal with the ways bitcoin markets will respond to any future turmoil in U.S. bond valuations. Extended portions of this year have seen cryptocurrencies rally in periods where stocks are falling or economic data reports indicate upcoming macroeconomic weaknesses. Traditional market safe havens include assets like gold, bonds, and the U.S. dollar. However, two out of three of these instruments could be directly impacted by the negative effects of an inverted yield curve. Gold remains the only exception within this group of traditional safe-haven assets, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see digital assets benefit from recent economic developments given gold’s increasingly strengthening the relationship with bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, crypto investors will be watching to see if the market is truly prepared to redefine bitcoin as a safe haven instrument. Since recessionary periods are almost always accompanied by declines in stock markets, traditional equities investors will likely be looking for other places to park their money in the event of a downturn. Can bitcoin emerge as a winner during these types of scenarios? Of course, that still remains to be seen. However, recent trends indicate a growing interest amongst investors looking for the protection of cryptocurrency assets when all other markets are declining in value.

However, a crypto whale is confident that the #1 coin will drop below $8,000 by the end of August. Binance boss told crypto investors not to bet against Bitcoin. He hinted that the coin was in the middle of a rally that hasn’t reached its culmination yet. This is not financial advice, but you can slap yourself a little harder now.

Now the coin is trading at around $11,820 as at 11:30 GMT, after hitting a daily peak at $12,273, according to Coinmarketcap data. While the fundamentals are pointing to a continuation of the Bitcoin uptrend pushed by troubles in the traditional financial world, a crypto whale thinks otherwise. Twitter user @BitKrabs replied to CZ that he was ready to send him 10 BTC if the price doesn’t drop below $8,000 by the end of this month. Don’t bet against bitcoin? Okay, well i disagree, … if it doesn’t crash back below 8k this month, I’ll personally send you 10 BTC. — Kra₿₿y 🦀 (@BitKrabs) August 6, 2019  10 BTC is worth $118,000 as of now, so the bet is daring to say the least. @BitKrabs claims to be a crypto whale and Bitcoin fund manager. He elaborated on his price outlook for August in a separate tweet: #Bitcoin August Analysis:$BTC will fail to break next resistance! 1. What will happen instead is we will reject it, then nose dive to the 7.5-8K Range. 2. We will likely re-test 9K~ around the middle of August. 3. Final dip to the yellow line.

While Bitcoin has already broken the $12,000 level, it fell back below it as of now. We’ll see what happen in the coming days. As you could expect, @BitKrabs’ tweet attracted many “crypto beggars” who implored the analyst to send 10 BTC, or at least 1 BTC, to their address instead of CZ, who is already rich. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is confidently moving upward driven by geopolitical uncertainty. Yesterday, we explained that the worsening Sino-US trade tensions forced the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to devalue its currency by almost 1.50% in an unexpected move. The stock markets plunged, pushing Bitcoin up thanks to its safe-haven status. Note that the year-to-date high was hit at the end of June when Bitcoin traded above $13,750.

However, as a foil to ‘moon BTC‘, she is behind it all the way. Bitcoin’s most recent rally, along with the seemingly synchronized devaluation of the Chinese Yuan, prompted speculation that the two were linked. Could Chinese investors be fleeing the weakening Yuan and running into the open arms of BTC? However, Dovey Wan took to Twitter to pour cold water on the suggestion, chiefly for two major reasons: ""Chinese buying up Bitcoin"" is a VERY dubious narrative IMO 1. Bitcoin is trading at a negative premium in Chinese centric exchanges like Huobi and Okex 2. RMB denominated OTC price is now at 1% premium, within its normal range since the bull — Dovey Wan 🗝 🦖 (@DoveyWan) August 5, 2019  The ongoing trade war between the United States and China has caused global financial uncertainty, which can certainly help to boost the bitcoin market. But Wan feels that the capital is more likely to be coming from outside of China. Most recently, U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose 10% tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese imports. China pledged to retaliate, and the U.S. has accused it of being a ‘currency manipulator‘, following the devaluation of the Yuan yesterday. But Wan suggests that a surer hedge against global financial uncertainty would be Tether, although this is also currently selling at a negative premium in Chinese markets. In fact, in Yuan terms, it was gold which saw a spike in volume and prices yesterday. After pointing out her reasoning against the ‘Chinese buying up bitcoin’ narrative, Wan conceded that we would all be pretty happy with a sound narrative to encourage bitcoin price to ‘moon’. On this basis, she concurred, tongue firmly in cheek: “I totally buy into this” Do you think the Chinese are stacking sats as the yuan is tumbling?

The loot has been pilfered from cyber-attacks and cryptocurrency exchange hacks according to the confidential dossier. According to Reuters, a United Nations report has exposed that the despotic regime has accumulated as much as $2 billion for its weapons of mass destruction projects. The findings to the UN Security Council North Korea sanctions committee added Pyongyang … continued to enhance its nuclear and missile programmes although it did not conduct a nuclear test or ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) launch. [And continues to] launder stolen proceeds and create income to avoid international sanctions. The draft report has been compiled by a panel of independent experts monitoring sanctions compliance over the past six months. It continued, stating that state sponsored cyber criminals launched increasingly sophisticated attacks to steal assets from financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges. The Reconnaissance General Bureau, which is believed to be behind the cyber-attacks, is a top North Korean military intelligence agency. The report added that crypto exchanges were targeted because shifting funds from them is harder to detect; at least 35 reported instances of DPRK actors attacking financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges and mining activity designed to earn foreign currency in some 17 countries. This time last year it was reported that the Lazarus hacking group had resurfaced with new software that targeted cryptocurrency traders. The malware once installed opened a series of back doors allowing remote access. Dubbed AppleJeus, it targeted MacOS much to the chagrin of Apple aficionados who believe their products are immune from such incursions. US president Trump visited the autocratic nation and its leader Kim Jong Un in June, however talks failed to reach conclusion. A raft of sanctions is still in place which has forced Pyongyang to seek alternative methods of evading them and funding its weapons programs. A US State Department spokeswoman issued a call to arms in response to the report. We call upon all responsible states to take action to counter North Korea’s ability to conduct malicious cyber activity, which generates revenue that supports its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs. South Korea has also repeatedly accused the North of cyber-attacks and cryptocurrency exchange hacks. A report released earlier this year from the UK’s Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) also confirmed an increase in nefarious online activity from the regime. Cryptocurrency has been highlighted as the financial vehicle of choice and exchanges in Southeast Asia were advised to be more vigilant with security practices and KYC procedures.

Presenting new figures on social media August 6, Avichal Garg, who now runs cryptocurrency asset management firm Electric Capital, said standard methods for measuring Bitcoin’s dominance were flawed.  Resources which compute market cap, specifically CoinMarketCap, draw on thousands of cryptocurrencies, including those with no liquidity at all. This, he argues, makes them irrelevant to calculations and allows them to dilute Bitcoin’s true presence. “True BTC market share is probably 75%+ and has likely been 60%+ for a long time,” he wrote.  Coinmarketcap incorrectly calculates dominance using alts that have 0 liquidity. Most (though (definitely) not all!) projects are worth 0, which would put BTC dominance at 75%+ Bitcoin’s market cap currently circles $317 billion after a several-day bull run took the largest cryptocurrency over $12,000 once more.  Dominance for Bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap, is 68.5%, the highest the percentage has been since April 2017.  While altcoins remain factored in, the landscape this year overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin investors, with multiple analysts warning that altcoin markets will no longer challenge Bitcoin in a meaningful way.  Garg’s calculations surface several weeks after another alternative metric for gauging market cap hit an all-time high of its own.  As Bitcoinist reported, so-called ‘realized market cap’ reached a record $93 billion last month, and has since continued to fresh highs – currently at $97.8 billion.   Realized market cap refers to the price at which a bitcoin last traded, along with how many coins moved in that trade.  By multiplying those two values it generates a number which more accurately judges Bitcoin’s health, analysis from industry media resource Longhash said.  Market cap is just one aspect of the Bitcoin network that been consistently breaking records in the 2019 bull market. As Bitcoinist noted, hashrate, difficulty, volume and more are all at highs which were unthinkable at the beginning of the year.  Even temporary bearish sentiment sparked by US regulatory scrutiny failed to last, with BTC/USD bouncing back by over $2000 in a matter of days since the start of the weekend. Trade war worries, coupled with wider economic uncertainty, fuelled the action which also resulted in improved performance for safe haven assets such as gold.   What do you think about Bitcoin’s market cap?

All of this shows bitcoin is solidifying its position as a true macro force in the financial markets. A recent tweet from Ceteris Paribus pointed out two important market moves, as BTC/USD bounced from the August 2nd lows at $10,365 while USD/CNY rallied to ¥6.9479. Three days later, even larger moves occurred in the renminbi as USD/CNY was pegged at an opening rate of ¥7.0120 before moving to highs of ¥7.0513 during the U.S. session. USD/CNY This move came as BTC/USD bounced from August 5th lows at $10,973 en route to highs of $11,939 late in the U.S. session. Interestingly, this is actually the third event like this which has happened over the last week, as an earlier precursor occurred on August 1st. On this day, the USD/CNY currency pair bounced from lows at ¥6.8821 while valuations in BTC/USD found strong buyers at the $9,875 level. When BTC/USD and USD/CNY show gains at the same time, markets are actually indicating a surge in bitcoin relative to the Chinese yuan. BTC/USD Bitcoinist writer Martin Young recently raised key questions about whether Chinese investors and consumers are viewing bitcoin as a viable currency alternative during periods of internal market volatility. A clear confluence in the relative value of each of these currencies (both fiat and digital) confirms that the answer to this important question is likely “yes.” On the fundamental side of the equation, it’s clear that moves in the Chinese currency have been prompted as a retaliatory response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to initiate a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods. Given the prolonged trade discussions we have been seeing between the two countries, this type of policy maneuvering is not altogether surprising. But what is surprising is the market’s response through cryptocurrency, which is now essentially functioning as a safe-haven asset. Shortly after a Chinese court recognized the legality of bitcoin as digital property, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) gave its stamp of approval for its usage when it placed an infographic on its website which outlines the history and usage of bitcoin. Overall, this is a highly bullish event for the cryptocurrency space, as it suggests increased utility for digital assets in one of the world’s largest markets. Since offshore Chinese yuan is currently trading near its record lows, traders might begin to expect continued volatility in BTC/USD given the strong correlation these currencies have displayed over the last week’s time. However, recent trend developments from Chinese investors and consumers indicate that the latest upside rallies in BTC/USD have room to continue.

The LTC/USD instrument earlier today established a local high of 107.04 on San Francisco-based Coinbase exchange. The move uphill brought the pair up by 12.30 percent from the market open. That was also the time when the Litecoin blockchain was close to reaching the block height of 1,680,000, after which it would reduce its supply rate from the previous 25 LTC per 2.5 minutes to 12.5 LTC per 2.5 minutes. At around 10:15 UTC, Litecoin underwent the so-called halving process. Fifteen minutes later, the cryptocurrency’s rate started heading downwards, as shown in the chart below. Litecoin Price Plunges by 7% Post Halving | Image Credits: TradingView.com Up until 13:30 UTC, the LTC/USD rate had dropped to 97.11, down 9.28 percent from the local top. The move expressed the need of day traders to take their sessional profits home. At the same time, it showed the absence of a stronger bullish bias at the moment that earlier prompted Litecoin to register more than 200 percent in year-to-date returns. Halvings are bullish, according to a textbook supply-demand model. Such events keep reducing the supply of digital assets after a specific time – up to a certain cap limit. And if the demand for those assets grows higher post the halving event, then the underlying scarcity alone makes them more expensive to purchase. Halvings are also problematic if the miners – people who run expensive rigs to mine cryptocurrencies – get disappointed now that they receive a lesser reward for confirming and adding transactions to the blockchains. So far, there are no signs of a hash rate drop in the Litecoin blockchain, which means that miners are still running the network. Since the halving, 12 blocks have been found in 17 minutes. Seems like miners have not shut off their hashrate at all. Instead, we are mining at a rate of a block every 1.4 minutes on average, which is much faster than the expected 2.5 minutes. Litecoin network is healthy! pic.twitter.com/xvgefqIPtP — Charlie Lee [LTC⚡] (@SatoshiLite) August 5, 2019  The normalcy among miners leaves the Litecoin market in the hands of a handful of technicals. Traders willing to drop their LTC bags for an attractive intraday profit appears logical at this point, which is why the market is experiencing a sharp correction. More likely, it could be the silver cryptocurrency preparing for a consolidation price action the same as the last time. Comparing Bitcoin and Litecoin Halving | Image Credits: Messari.io The last Litecoin halving did not impact the price much, according to data fetched by Messari.io. The LTC/USD rate merely surged by 16 percent one year after the event. Bitcoin did better, on the other hand. The golden cryptocurrency had surged 292 percent one year after going through its last halving – and 838 percent after two-years. If Litecoin continues to remain idiosyncratic, then there is no upside move in the cards. Else, following bitcoin’s footsteps could yield better results. With creator Charlie Lee rolling out privacy features later this year, Litecoin just might be in for an upside, after all. It is the first time the cryptocurrency rose ahead of its halving – for starters. Was today’s halving actually supposed to propel Litecoin price beyond previous all-time highs?

Since then, bulls have been well in control resulting in further upside towards $12,000. On the 1 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see how Bitcoin price entered into a clear period of consolidation inside an asymmetrical triangle, stemming from $11,500 throughout the middle of July to the new range low at $9,100. Bulls have since regained control and managed to win a compelling breakout to the upside. This resulted in price levels returning back to where the period of consolidation begun at $11,500. POC (Point of Control) has begun to move up on this breakout to the upside meaning there is a lot of buying pressure taking place throughout this uptrend.  This is a far cry from the buying and selling pressure seen throughout the period of consolidation, and will likely result in a sustainable uptrend with $9,100 remaining the range low. 200 EMA approaching the POC at $10,590 is likely to become a short-term pull-back target for bear traders. As you can see, current price levels are quite overextended at the moment which will likely result in a brief pullback to sustain the newly formed short-term trend. This is why it makes sense to target the POC, as support now lies at this point. There will need to be a large amount of selling pressure in order for price levels to break below $10,590 at POC, along with the other main supports at $10,170, and $9,890. On the 30 minute chart for XBT/USD, we can see how Bitcoin’s price has developed since the breakout more clearly. POC has moved up around $200 so it makes sense to take the 1 hour POC price at $10,590 and the 30 Minute POC price at $10,790 to create a ”range” of key support to target for a pull-back. As you can see, volume has increased throughout the last 24 hours as FOMO traders anticipate the key resistance above at $12,422 being broken. Key resistance lies at $12,400 which is just shy of the yearly highs of $13,400 and $13,900. It’s likely that if BTC bulls muster up enough bullish momentum to break $12,400 then both of the yearly highs will be surpassed shortly after. This is very similar to what was mentioned in my previous analysis on BTC where I talked about there being little resistance between $11,000 and $12,000. This has clearly come true with price action moving very quickly after $11,000 was broken. Do you think BTC is ready to surpass key resistance at $12,400?

Here are the main reasons behind Bitcoin’s latest 10% gain. Last week, US President Donald Trump said that the US was ready to introduce a new 10% import tariff on Chinese goods word $300 million starting from September 1. In response, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) devalued the currency by almost 1.50%. As a result, both the onshore (CNY) and offshore (CNH) markets were trading above the psychological level of 7.00 against the American currency. For the CNY, this is the lowest level since April 2008. The central bank explained that the move is a reaction to upcoming tariffs on China. A cheaper Yuan helps China boost exports and offset some of the negative effects of the imposed tariffs. Unlike the US dollar or the euro, Yuan is not a free-floating currency. The PBOC achieves this by setting the price every day. The relationship between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is worsening. Some economists are anticipating no trade deal by the end of this year which could spell down for the global economy. The increased tensions and devalued Yuan has also  put pressure on the stock markets. On the other end, Bitcoin is standing out as the biggest winner today as it acts as a safe haven currency. On Monday August 5, the largest coin by market cap gained 9.92% to $11,767 during the Asian trading session. The cryptocurrency also appears bullish on the dovish sentiments from major central banks like the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB). Other drivers behind Bitcoin’s bull rally are likely to be sociopolitical tensions around the world, along with Tether’s expansion on multiple blockchains. In Hong Kong, the stock market has had its worst performance in several months as concerns over the ongoing political crisis drive investment overseas. Local residents are now organizing mass demonstrations with elements of violence, forcing hundreds of flights to and from the city to be cancelled.  In the US, two mass shootings occurred over the weekend, fuelling racism within the country. The first attack took place in El Paso, Texas, leaving 20 people dead, while there other shooting left 9 dead in Dayton, Ohio. And finally, worries over increased crypto market risk are plaguing the minds of many in the community this week as Tether continues to migrate across to new blockchains. The no-longer 1-1 pegged stablecoin is now available on EOS, Tron and the Liquid network.

Statistics from monitoring resource Coin Gecko confirmed the network’s capacity expanded 87% in the period from January 1 – June 30. At the same time, the number of available nodes doubled from 2298 to 4576, capitalizing on Bitcoin’s 00 bull market which has focused fresh attention on cryptocurrency markets.  The Lightning Network is a scaling solution currently active on both Bitcoin and Litecoin 00. Transactions occur outside the main blockchain, allowing funds to transfer between users almost instantly and with considerably lower fees than ‘on-chain’ transactions.  Even prior to the start of Bitcoin’s bull market in April, Lightning had gained increased publicity thanks to a charity initiative organized by one of its users, Hodlonaut.  Taking the form of a transaction relay to test the strength of the protocol, Lightning Torch ended up involving some of the tech world’s biggest names, including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who publicly condoned it.  While the amount of money involved was limited – around 0.4 BTC ($4700) – the relay brought the still-nascent LN to a mainstream audience, ensuring its continued expansion within the Bitcoin community.  Since July, however, some data reveals that both capacity and the number of payment channels active on Lightning have shrunk.  As Reddit user u/hotol noted on August 4, this in fact is not a reflection of progress reversing. Rather, shifts in user behavior influences figures, with LN by default designed to make usage difficult to gauge publicly.  Resources tracking its public aspects, principally 1ML.com, thus do not paint a complete picture of events, and using them to conclude LN is shrinking constitutes “FUD” An accompanying post summarized, LN network arguably has today much more public capacity than needed for me and you to make everyday payments. Real LN capacity is much higher than what 1ml.com reports due to private channels – and recently capacity has been migrating to private channels, There is really nothing to see here, use LN and enjoy the only true P2P, instant and private payments in the crypto space. As Bitcoinist reported, Lightning remains a broadly experimental option for Bitcoiners, only debuting on the Bitcoin mainnet at the start of 2018. The user experience is still geared towards technically-proficient traders, while an active community continues to make it more ready for the mainstream.

Uzbekistani Som']","  Emilio Janus | Aug 05, 2019 | 08:00 A satoshi isn’t worth much, but that’s by design. At one hundred-millionth of a bitcoin, it’s the smallest unit BTC is divisible into. If bitcoin price hits $1 million, then a microbitcoin (mBTC) will be worth a dollar, and a satoshi, the equivalent of one cent. However, one satoshi is already worth more than several national currencies. Which means that in some countries, owning just one-hundredth of a bitcoin would make you a millionaire. Top (or should that be bottom) of the charts when it comes to ‘how many can you buy for a satoshi?’, is the Iranian Rial. After the United States unilaterally withdrew from the international Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and reimposed sanctions, the Iranian economy has suffered greatly. In an attempt to counter this, the Iranian authorities reversed an earlier ban on bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and more recently, approved cryptocurrency mining in the country. Currency value has continued to tumble, however, and you can currently buy five rials for just one satoshi. Next up is the Vietnamese Dong. Mildly amusing name aside, one satoshi could buy you 2.75 dong at current rates. Perhaps this should serve as a warning against anti-cryptocurrency sentiment. Last summer, the Vietnamese Central Bank called for a ban on the imports of cryptocurrency mining rigs. This was swiftly followed by a blanket ban on all cryptocurrency-related activities. This hardline stance seems to be easing, with a reportedly fully-authorized crypto-exchange announced earlier this year. Whether this improves the outlook for the dong remains to be seen. Indonesia is another country that imposed an all-out ban on cryptocurrencies, only to later soften its position. Unfortunately, more recent moves have seen excessive capital requirement and AML regulation, cause BTC traders to ditch cryptocurrency exchanges in favor of LocalBitcoins. One satoshi is worth 1.7 of the local currency, the Indonesian Rupiah. The West-African Republic of Guinea uses the Guinean Franc as its national currency. At this point in our list, we are coming to almost parity between the sovereign currencies and a satoshi, as one satoshi has the same value as 1.08 Guinean Francs. That’s really nothing to be proud of though. The Guinean Franc is also divided into 100 centimes, although no coins or notes in these denominations have ever been issued. Another West-African nation, Sierra Leone last year became the first country to use blockchain-verified voting in its presidential elections. You can still get 1.08 of its national currency, the Leone, for a single satoshi though. The official national currency of Laos, the Lao Kip is relatively valuable… compared to the Iranian Rial at the top of our list, that is. One satoshi is worth 1.02 kip at current rates. Uzbekistan was one of three countries which expressed an interest to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in issuing Bitcoin-backed sovereign bonds. Well, it makes more sense than issuing bonds in the national Uzbekistani Som. You could buy 1.02 of those with just one satoshi. A single satoshi is now worth more than national currencies. 0.00000001 BTC is worth more than 1: Iranian Rial  🇮🇷Vietnamese Dong  🇻🇳Indonesian Rupiah  🇮🇩Guinean Franc  🇬🇳 Sierra Leonean Leone  🇸🇱Laotian Kip  🇱🇦Uzbekistani Som 🇺🇿 Bitcoin is a black hole, consuming fiat! — Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) August 3, 2019  Do you think Bitcoin will eventually suck the entire global fiat supply?

With a 10 percent surge on the day BTC has reached a three week high while in China, the Yuan collapses to a 10-year low against the greenback. Are the Chinese loading up on bitcoin? As we have seen on countless occasions recently, trading in Asia is dictating market movements for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Just a few hours ago BTC touched a three week high of $11,850 according to the Tradingview charts. The move has added over 10 percent to bitcoin’s price in less than 24 hours. There are a number of factors that could be driving the momentum fundamentally. One is the mass liquidation of short positions on BitMEX which has seen over $100 million dissolved over the last day as the bears get battered. Another is the fall in the Chinese Yuan which has dumped below 7 against the dollar, its lowest level in a decade. According to a CNN report this morning, the Yuan weakened sharply after the People’s Bank of China set its daily reference rate for the currency at 6.9225. The central bank cited ‘trade protectionism and new tariffs on China’ as its reasoning for the slide. US President Trump ramped up the trade war with a fresh round of tariffs on China last week. Devaluing its currency is one weapon China has against the US economically but it is not without risk. The weakening currency will increase fears about capital outflows from the country. Beijing has already slapped restrictions on moving money out of China so it appears that bitcoin has become the vehicle of choice. Chief Investment Officer of Hayman Capital Management, Kyle Bass, is among several industry professionals to observe what is happening on crypto twitter today: “CNH collapsing… HKD won’t be far behind. Mass Exodus of capital out of CNH and HKD. This collapse has just begun.” GAMETIME – CNH collapsing…HKD won’t be far behind. Mass Exodus of capital out of CNH and HKD.

It had never had more than $100M in a single month,” the Twitter account known as Ceteris Paribus, which reported the Token Analyst findings, summarized Sunday. By contrast, 2018 saw inflows of $1.3 billion, with inflows beating outflows every month, despite the bearish sentiment which characterized markets at the time.  Bitmex had $524M net outflows in July. It had never had more than $100M in a single month. 2018 brought in $1.3B, and there was not a single month where outflows were greater than inflows. pic.twitter.com/yfQSMfCbvy — Ceteris Paribus (@ceterispar1bus) August 4, 2019  BitMEX sees giant volumes during periods of Bitcoin price volatility, with traders even becoming well known for gaining or losing huge amounts in leveraged trades.  In July, rumors began circulating that US regulators were investigating BitMEX over executives’ alleged failure to prevent US citizens from using its services.  Due to regulatory issues, US residents are currently shut out from many crypto-based products and services, with authorities concerned not enough is being done to prevent traders circumventing roadblocks.  The exact nature of the investigation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) remains unclear, with official sources yet to confirm events.  Scrutiny appeared to follow criticism of both BitMEX and its CEO Arthur Hayes by Nouriel Roubini, the serial Bitcoin naysayer with whom Hayes had a fierce debate several weeks previously.  After video evidence of the debate took longer than planned to go public, Roubini hit out at Hayes, questioning the legality of his operations in a dedicated research piece. “…Despite the overwhelming evidence of rampant fraud and abuse, financial regulators and law-enforcement agencies remain asleep at the wheel,” he claimed. Hayes meanwhile has since gone quiet, posting only on social media, in which he said he had “traded in a yacht for the jungle” and that he would return to normal duties in September. The first days of August meanwhile appeared to spell some light relief, with inflows beating outflows after a major cashing out effort by investors at the end of July.  Other activities also continue, BitMEX investing as part of a funding round for Rain, the Middle East’s first regulated cryptocurrency exchange, in a deal revealed last week.

According to the published research, most of the bitcoin selling comes from short-term holders. This trend implies long-term hodling among staunch BTC believers. 0/ The Perfect Storm for Bitcoin is Brewing.Our team just released our Quarterly Macro Outlook, which digs deep into the key drivers behind Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a non-sovereign, digitally native store of value. Quick summary thread: https://t.co/cBcvmbcNkr — Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) August 3, 2019  The crypto market analytics firm provided a UTXO analysis showing short-term BTC holders being behind the Q2 bitcoin price rally. During this period, the bitcoin price surge from $4,000, to $13,000. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, bitcoin’s untouched supply has reached a new high of 21.6%. Long-term holding and lost coins reduce BTC’s total supply which is already capped at 21 million thus creating greater scarcity and by extension more value per “coin.” Delphi Digital also highlighted the role of dovish monetary policies in driving up bitcoin price in the long-term. An excerpt from the report reads: Speaking of which, global central banks are in a race to cut interest rates amid a backdrop of slowing economic activity and tepid inflation. The Federal Reserve cut rates 25 bps just this week for the first time in over a decade as inflationary pressures remain suppressed. These monetary policies create increased liquidity which, in turn, could see greater inflow into BTC which will act as powerful tailwinds for upward bitcoin price action.  According to the crypto analytics firm, the risk of a recession in the U.S. is rising fast. This imminent threat is also being materially exacerbated by a global loosening of monetary policies by central banks. While there is no historical context for bitcoin price performance in a recession, the team at Delphi Digital says that gold provides a useful analog. According to Delphi Digital, gold tends to rise when real yields fall. Already, there is an emerging inversion in the yield curve for 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds — a known precursor to recessions. Amid these bleak economic expectations, Delphi Digital joins others in presenting bitcoin as a haven asset. In the short-term, increased liquidity will cause an influx of money into the BTC market, along with other asset classes. However, as mainstream markets begin to contract, the smart money will elect to move into bitcoin as a hedge against the uncertainties developing in the mainstream arena. Another excerpt from the report reads: The asymmetrical upside to BTC, if it lives up to its “digital gold” hype, would make any growth investor salivate, especially if the FAANG-type names become even more crowded. Simply put, bitcoin has one of the highest growth potentials of any asset globally. What is your long-term bitcoin price prediction? Let us know in the comments below.

On July 24th, the BSV network underwent a scheduled network upgrade with the intent to raise the blocksize from 128 MB to 2 GB. A whopping 19% failed to follow last months upgrade, while another 17% had their nodes crash when receiving the 210 MB block. Some popular BSV services such as coin.dance and MoneyButton got stuck at the 210 MB block, unable to keep up with the rest of the network. Ryan X Charles, CEO of MoneyButton and a devout SV supporter, talked about his issues running an SV node on the MoneyButton blog Yesterday, Money Button went down because our Bitcoin SV node ran out of memory and crashed during a stress test. The node ran out of memory because we were using an underpowered instance. We have upgraded the instance to be sufficient for the largest block sizes that are currently possible. Money Button was back online after about three hours of downtime. Our new instance will cost thousands of dollars per month to operate. As blocks continue to get larger and we have to upgrade the instance many times, this cost will balloon. Bitcoin SV’s main selling point is their unrealistic blocksize limit, however, that is proving to be much more of an attack vector than a feature. For example, this chain split alone resulted in nearly 300 Petahashes/second dropping off the network. The network is now back to just around 1,200 Ph/s. The network has, for the most part, gotten itself back in consensus since the split. Coin.dance is now back following the SV chain and no one is mining the legacy chain, leaving it to die. The victims of this network error were those small miners that were unable to keep up with the absurd blocksizes. It is very likely they spent a large chunk of time and hashpower mining the old chain, only to have those blocks orphaned in favor of the longer chain.  Bitcoin SV, unlike many other crypto-currencies, is extremely centralized in terms of hash rate. One company, Coingeek, owns or indirectly controls the mining pools Coingeek, SVPool, and Mempool.com. Together, those pools make up over half the Bitcoin SV hashrate. When the massive block hit nodes around the world, Coingeek forced the network to keep following their chain with their control of the network. There’s nearly no genuine economic activity happening on the BSV chain, but if something similar were to happen on a chain like BTC, BCH, or ETH, things would have been much messier. In the future, it will be possible to run a node capable of handling 210+MB blocks on mid-range hardware. Block propagation technology such as Graphene can reduce the block transmission size by around 99.6%. Developers like Johnathon Toomim have successfully tested 3,000 tx/s running on a modified version of Bitcoin ABC. In the meantime, there needs to be a reasonable cap on the blocksize limit to avoid that potential attack vector. Otherwise, a malicious actor could very easily send out a block that would  This is the exact reason for BTC’s reluctance to increase the blocksize. They’re worried the network could fragment if blocks that are too large are mined, hence the focus on off-chain solutions. SV’s mindset is bigger is better, no exceptions. BCH is taking more of a middle of the road approach, increasing the blocksize when it’s safe to do so based on software optimization and hardware improvements. The cryptocurrency community hasn’t really seen a three-way chain split before, but it more than likely won’t be the last. With SV’s new 2 GB cap, we could see gigabyte blocks or even bigger in the coming months. If and when we see blocks that big, we may even see a chain split more than three ways. What do you think about Bitcoin SV’s current issues? Do they have a future in the space? Should Bitcoin increase their blocksize at all?

Proving that however disparate its politics are, Great Britain will always remain just 22 miles from mainland Europe. But what has been coming together in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency this week? And what seems further away than ever?  I’ve always said that Bitcoin is a bit of a contrarian. Once you expect it to do something then it will often do the opposite, seemingly just for kicks. So just as analysts had resigned themselves to more accumulation (and even potential further drops), the past week pulled a $1k gain out of the bag. The week started on a negative vibe; the flash crash that ended the previous week still playing on the minds of many. A dip into the $8000s was predicted by some. One analysts even predicted a ‘wild card’ drop to $4k before the next rally begins was likely. Whilst support held steady for the first part of the week, a descending triangle pattern led to the prediction of a challenging August to come. And then, looming on the horizon, someone spotted a ‘golden cross‘on the 3-day chart, often viewed as an indicator of bullish times ahead. Price started to creep upwards, overtaking the 200-day moving average (MA), as a former Goldman Sachs executive described it as ‘ludicrously underpriced‘. A rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve pushed price even higher, breaking back into five figures. One analyst confidently stated that we should never see bitcoin prices as low as $6000 again… with the caveat that if we do we should buy lots. Bulls even seemed to be pushing back towards $11k, before taking a short breather this morning. However, Max’s ‘Keiser-sense’ was tingling, causing him to make a bold $15k prediction for the coming week. We await with bated breath. Australia this week introduced draft legislation to prohibit cash payments above $10,000, to assist in combatting tax evasion and criminal activity. Somewhat surprisingly, cryptocurrency was not only not included, but specifically excluded from this legislation. Makes a change from Bitcoin being blamed for all criminal activity and money laundering. Meanwhile India’s top tech bod criticised the governments proposed blanket ban of cryptocurrency. The United Kingdom’s top financial watchdog decided that Bitcoin and Ether do not require regulation, although certain utility and stablecoins will. In a bit of a coup, LedgerX seemed to have leapfrogged Bakkt, and started selling ‘regulated’ physically backed Bitcoin futures products. However, the CFTC quickly stepped in and pointed out that the product could not self-certify (like Bakkt), and that its lack of response for 180-days did not constitute a ‘lack of disapproval’. It certainly constitutes a lack of something though. During another U.S. Senate hearing on cryptocurrency, Chairman Crapo expressed a belief that Bitcoin could not be banned, even if the government wanted to. However, Facebook admitted that regulatory uncertainty may prevent its Libra currency from ever actually launching. We at Bitcoinist suggested that it was smaller nations who are the true pioneers of cryptocurrency regulation. And Anthony Pompliano speculated that Singapore may be the first country to go ‘all in’ on Bitcoin. Square’s Cash app doubled its year-on-year Bitcoin-generated revenues in Q2 2019. D-Day came and went in the trial between Bitfinex and the New York Attorney General (NYAG). The supreme court judge postponed his decision, asking for more time. Research showed that Bitcoin still completely dominates Cash and SV as a means of exchange. Also, BTC miners make more in transaction fees in the course of a day than miners of BCH and BSV combined do in a year. Perhaps this is one of the reasons that Roger Ver has ‘moved on’ from being CEO of Bitcoin.com? And of course, Craig Wright’s continued inability to stop calling out crypto proponents has led to more dirt being unearthed from his past. This time, he was exposed for being caught, admitting to, and fined, by the Australian tax office, for the offence of backdating business records in 2014. But of course, he’d never risk doing it again… would he? Usually vocal, social media mouthpiece and BitMEX CEO, Arthur Hayes, went AWOL on Twitter for 3 weeks, coinciding with a probe by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in BitMEX. Hayes has however, finally broke cover recently to tweet that he had exchanged the yacht for the jungle. Let’s hope he doesn’t go completely Colonel Kurtz.

Since then, the markets have cooled off putting the price of a single Bitcoin to $10,700 at the time of writing. On top of this bullish trend, BTC dominance has also been on the climb, from bouncing around 50% to over 65% as of today. Max Keiser, Founder of Heisenberg Capital, has been buying Bitcoin since the days it was worth only a dollar. Over the years he has been very vocal in his support for cryptocurrencies, encouraging others to invest and building within the space. He also is a strong believer in Bitcoin Maximalism, talking often about how the value in the cryptocurrencies space will flow into Bitcoin. Today on Twitter, he made his predictions on where he sees the price of BTC going in the short term. I’m sensing #Bitcoin will cross $15,000 this week. Confidence in central governments, central banks, and centralized, fiat money is at a multi-decade low. — Max Keiser, tweet poet. (@maxkeiser) August 3, 2019  While this prediction may be a bit optimistic, it is based off a major selling point of crypto-currencies over their centralized, state-backed counterparts; decentralization. Bitcoin is unique, its the first value transfer system that wasn’t controlled by a third party actor. Supporters have been said for years that a money system that wasn’t controlled by a central government is a much better alternative fiat currencies as there would be a safe, stable supply and be immune from federal monetary policy. And in the long run, that may hold true. Fears of a worldwide economic turn down have been spreading between economists lately, as the US-China trade war escalates and Britain heads faster and faster towards a no-deal Brexit, something that would send the region’s economy into chaos.  On top of these uncertainties affecting the market, many economists are predicting a general economic slowdown due to the explosion of several world economies over the last decade. In some countries, such as Venezuela and Zimbabwe, have experienced huge inflation rates over the last decade. Even with Bitcoins wild price swings, it can still be better than their local currencies. As economies all over the world run into more and more issues, many people may start to consider decentralized alternatives such as BTC or Bitcoin Cash to save or spend their money.

Now BTC bulls are heading back towards the $11,000 price mark forming a new uptrend.  On the 1 Hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see how the recent breakout of the asymmetrical triangle mentioned in a previous analysis has progressed over the last 3 days. The decision point range between $9,860 and $10,120 to determine the sustainability of the breakout has clearly broken to the upside resulting in a new sharp uptrend causing price levels to rise 11%. Volume has begun to pick back up on this move to the upside but still remains fairly low in comparison to the volume seen in the move to $13k throughout June and July. A pull-back to $10,120 is expected within the next 48 hours and would present an optimal re-entry opportunity. The next key resistance level to look out for on this move is $11,000. On the 4 Hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see the breakout and new short-term uptrend in comparison to prior price action. Once the key resistance point at $11,000 is broken there’s little to no resistance until $12,000 meaning price levels will likely move very quickly within this trading range. Maxx Momentum fired long right at the breakout point visible by the orange circles as momentum shifted to green, this is a sign of a strong breakout and that bears were really struggling to bring price levels down further. POC has moved up close to the current market price at $10,500 meaning lots of buying and selling is happening at this level and will likely become a new support zone. In order for this to happen price action must trade sideways within 3-4% of $10,500 over the coming days. Both the 15 MA and 50 EMA has visibly crossed up over each other on this breakout which again points to a confident breakout for bulls and is also a sign of a new stronger trend forming. $8,800 was the key support level that BTC has to hold in order for the short-term consensus to remain bullish. I mentioned in a previous analysis that it’s unlikely this level will break and would require a significant amount of selling pressure which clearly hasn’t come to fruition.

This figure is more than four times the $130,000 earned by miners on the BSV and BCH chains combined over the past 12 months. On July 31st, Bitcoin miners earned $540K in tx fees.

Much like the trend with transaction fees, the value of BTC transactions per day outstrips that of BSV and BCH combined by a wide margin. Bitcoin regularly posts $500,000 in transaction fees alone on a daily basis. BCH miners, by comparison, see under $200 in transaction fees per day. Back in April 2019, BSV miners were still running at a loss, five months after the chain split. Bcash has collected $156 in fees over the last 24 HRS . LMFAO ROFL Bcash is an unsustainable affinity scam. — AwyeeBitcoin 🌮 (@DeaterBob) August 2, 2019  The top-ranked crypto is still some way off from the likes of Visa in terms of the daily transaction load. Thus, for BCH and BSV, the distance to the pinnacle of global payments appears even more insurmountable. But for now, BTC remains the king of low fee money transfers. A few days ago, a bitcoin whale moved multiple $468 million transactions for less than $400 in fees – a far cry from the more than $1.6 million it would have cost using mainstream remittance avenues. The revelation of the massive gap in transaction fee earnings provides further proof of Bitcoin’s primacy over the forked chains. While touted as improvements, the likes of BCH and BSV have yet to show any ground-breaking results to justify the strong arguments that necessitated their emergence. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, 96% of Bitcoin SV transactions come from a weather app. With the talk of increasing the block size limit to 2GB, some have taken to troll BSV with funny commentary surrounding huge transaction blocks for weather reporting. Earlier in the year, exchanges like Binance delisted BSV in response to the cyberbullying campaign of its proponents — Craig S.

However, it has high hopes for a turnaround based on demand for new 7nm mining machines.  According to a report from a Chinese news outlet, Bitmain’s total operating income for Q1 was $1.082 billion dollars, with revenues split over the three months as $253 million, $253 million, and $579 million (respectively). January and February saw losses of $345 million and $280 million, although in March the company posted a profit of $315 million. Still, a $310 million loss over Q1 is not a good look. Reportedly, the loss was down to the offloading of outdated 16nm mining rig inventory at low prices. Despite Q1 losses, Bitmain expects a strong performance in H2, once its old stock has been cleared and the company starts selling its new 7nm machines. Bitmain has allegedly placed a large order for 7nm chips from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), with a lead time of 3 to 4 months. It expects cash flow to steadily increase in Q3 as advanced orders for the new machines come in, and then see explosive growth in earnings after the first 7nm rigs start to ship. It also anticipates a growth in profits on its artificial intelligence (AI) line of products. Bitmain will need to post some better results if it is to attract investors to its beleaguered IPO. The company has allegedly revived its IPO plans in the US, after the original filing in Hong Kong lapsed. Bitmain had a somewhat disastrous year in 2018 as prices fell across cryptocurrency markets, and it took an ill-advised gamble on Bitcoin Cash. This was considered by many to be good news for Bitcoin as mining became more decentralised and Bitmain’s mining dominance dropped. The upturn in the fortunes of Bitcoin have also helped Bitmain in its recovery, with some sources claiming that staff options have been already been completed, ahead of the revived IPO, which is now imminent.

Users of Apple’s new credit card be faced with a number of restrictions, and one of them is cryptocurrency purchases. As expected, Apple continues with its quest to dictate what users can and cannot do with the company’s products and services. The terms and conditions for the new credit card were posted on the Goldman Sachs website this week according to Reuters. The Goldman involvement is part of the bank’s longer-term partnership with Apple to build a consumer-facing business. Part of the Apple Card customer agreement included a clause that prohibited the purchase of cash advances or cryptocurrencies The restrictions continued with casino gaming chips, race track wagers or lottery tickets. The tech giant may just as well say ‘only for shopping in the Apple Store’, as that appears to have been its primary intention. The report added that it is not uncommon for credit card providers to block bitcoin and crypto purchases adding that several banks have already done so including Lloyds Banking Group Plc, Virgin Money, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup. Following heavy reliance on iPhone sales, which have slumped 12% in the last quarter, the company is expanding its efforts to derive more income from services. In addition to the bitcoin blockade, the tech giant has restricted use of the credit card with jailbroken devices. To apply for a card, users must sign up and be approved via the Wallet app on iOS, additionally, the agreement says the device must be “eligible” to qualify. Jailbreaking is the process of removing Apple restrictions to allow the installation of third-party non-approved applications. In other words, allowing consumers to do what they want with their own devices and not what Apple wants. According to the customer agreement, Apple will lock users out of their credit card accounts if there are any attempts to modify their devices. “If you make unauthorized modifications to your Eligible Device, such as by disabling hardware or software controls (for example, through a process sometimes referred to as “jailbreaking”), your Eligible Device may no longer be eligible to access or manage your Account” The Apple Card is due to be released later this month and is likely to appeal only to diehard Apple nuts since ordinary credit cards have far fewer constraints.

On Friday Ikigai Asset Management released its tenth monthly crypto and traditional market update and the report was filled with some intriguing Bitcoin price action observations. Ikigai believes that the crypto-sector can “fundamentally change the world and create trillions of dollars of value in the process.”  The asset management firm also firmly believes that the crypto-market is “well on its way to new ATHs for BTC after a truly spectacular Q2-19 – the fourth-best quarterly performance since 2012.” In fact, Ikigai explicitly said:  In our Monthly Update letter that went out June 1st we said, “last month we stated that new all-time highs were well within reach for 2020. We now believe that may have proven too conservative, and there is a meaningful chance new ATHs are possible in 2019, and likely in 2020. Ikigai supported this conclusion by pointing out that: Ikigai also suggested that the crypto market’s bullish sentiment is partially driven by Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency. According to Ikigai:  Facebook’s Libra project is tremendously important to the crypto ecosystem. While Libra competes with certain crypto projects, it does not compete with Bitcoin – it is a gateway to Bitcoin. With 2.4bn MAU’s across the Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram platforms, Libra has the potential to bring the concept of “value accrual in digital assets” to the world at a scale never before seen. Kling confidently asserts that “we are in the midst of a raging bull market [but it is] important to note [that] we are experiencing a significant and much-needed pullback.” Ikigai explained that a strong correction was expected as Bitcoin had already appreciated by +60% in the month of June.  The report also mentioned that the strong pullback resulted in more than $260 million worth of long liquidations on Bitmex in just one hour.  As the chart shows below, Bitcoin was severely overbought and in historical correction territory.  The report also delves a bit into the world of conspiracy theory by suggesting that:  While a deeper pullback in the near term is certainly possible, we believe it is most likely simply an engineered opportunity for Risky Whales to profit from short-term shorts and accumulate more BTC at lower prices before taking the market to new YTD highs. The report points out that another case for Bitcoin rallying toward new all-time highs is Bitcoin’s rising dominance level. In June the dominance rate rose to heights not seen since the 2017 bull market.  Ikigai attributes this rise in BTC dominance to improving fundamentals and deep interest from institutional investors. According to Ikigai: BTC is separating itself from the rest of the crypto asset landscape in terms of institutional investability. The report takes a deep view at an array of metrics (hash rate, volume, on-chain activity, USDT printing, short and long-term price action ) and Ikagai concludes that despite the current pullback, Bitcoin is incredibly bullish.  The firm suggests that the upcoming Bitcoin halving event will catalyze a powerful bull market which will take Bitcoin and the crypto-sector to new all-time highs.  Do you think Bitcoin price will rally to $2o,000 before the end of 2019?

But that does not stop his former advisers from saying positive words about the world’s most expensive crypto asset. Steve Bannon, who was the chief strategist to Trump during his first seven months in the White House, thinks cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have a big future. The controversial right-winger said in an interview with CNBC Squawk Box that he was confidently purchasing the cryptocurrency when it was going down during the 2018 meltdown, adding: I think they could be a very important part going forward particularly in this global populist revolt. ""I think cryptocurrencies have a big future,"" says Steve Bannon. ""I think they could be a very important part going forward particularly in this global populist revolt."" pic.twitter.com/lYce7qzrIY — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) August 2, 2019  Populism, according to many political think tanks, defines the cause of ordinary persons in a democracy against vested interests. Bitcoin, which rose to fame in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, has long posed itself as an independent currency, wherein the community joins hands to produce fresh bitcoin tokens (with a hard cap of 21 million) units), confirm transactions, and maintain the entire transactional history on an unhackable public ledger. Bannon, who has long been a part of the so-called ‘bitcoin revolution’, has repeatedly claimed that he likes the cryptocurrency. In an interview last July with CNBC, he claimed that he owns some as well. “They are the future,” Bannon said of cryptocurrencies. Bannon was speaking on the sidelines of Trump’s announcement to slap additional tariffs of $300 billion on Chinese imports. The conversation slipped into the area of cryptocurrencies when one of the CNBC hosts asked Bannon about his views of Facebook Libra. A cryptocurrency enthusiast, Bannon insisted that Libra is an answer to China’s WeChat that could boost dollar’s online users across the world, especially in the countries that are already testing such solutions. He said, People have to confront how China and third world countries are starting to put payment systems in place that are going to try to give them global dominance and be able to get off the reserve currency of the dollar The comments differ hugely with a majority of lawmakers and regulators in the US who see both Libra and Bitcoin as tools to run money laundering scams. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in mid-July, called cryptocurrencies “a national security issue.” Even though the stop button is pressed hard, bitcoin cannot be stopped, admits U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho). If the United States were to decide, and I’m not saying it should, if the United States decided we didn’t want cryptocurrency to happen in the United States and tried to ban it, I’m pretty confident we couldn’t succeed in doing that because this is a global tech, a global innovation.

Anyway, if the coin tumbles to that level, we should buy lots of it. This is the conclusion of Timothy Peterson, a chartered financial analyst (CFA) and fund manager. Yesterday, Peterson tweeted that Bitcoin would never drop to $6,000 in our lifetime. While this prediction sounds daring, the analyst used a financial simulation technique called Monte Carlo. This algorithmic simulation helps analysts understand the probability of various outcomes in a process that is hardly predictable because of random influences. Given that the Bitcoin market is still at an emerging phase, it can go one direction or another based on unexpected variables related to regulation, demand, and competition, among others. Analysts use the Monte Carlo simulation to anticipate the influence of risk and uncertainty in the market. Peterson’s chart shows multiple outcomes that include the worst-case and best-case scenarios. The two-year forecast is seeded with weighted past monthly data and variance. Pretty sure we'll never see #bitcoin = $6,000 again, not in our lifetimes.  If $BTC dips to that or below, you should buy lots of it. pic.twitter.com/WCJ69zr2Sw — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredcrypto) August 1, 2019  Thus, Bitcoin might hit $38,000 by 2021 in the best-case scenario. The lowest probable price by that time is between $11,000 and $13,000. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $10,600 as at 15:40 GMT, after surging over 5.5% in the last 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap data. The rally is mainly driven by the recent interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, which makes the American currency less attractive for investors. When replying to a Twitter commentator, Peterson explained: The purpose is to show that downside risk is limited, and that upside projections of 100k, 300k, and 400k are crazy. In March of this year, Peterson published a research paper titled “Bitcoin Spreads Like a Virus.” The document discusses the correlation between the increase in the number of users and the price of the cryptocurrency. It uses a mathematical methodology based on Metcalfe’s Law, according to which the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users. Peterson compared Bitcoin with Facebook and concluded that: There is compelling evidence that suggests that the growth and price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are likely to proceed according to a relatively straightforward mathematical model, on which is similar to the growth curves of Facebook and other networks. Using observed data for both Facebook and Bitcoin, we derive the relationships between price, number of users, and time, and show that the resulting market capitalizations likely follow a Gompertz sigmoid growth function. The function was used to represent the growth of viruses and bacteria, hence the title. The conclusion is that the long-term growth rate in Bitcoin users will boost the price of the coin. Using this model, Peterson expects the BTC price to hit $160,000 by 2025. Two things I can promise you about January 20th, 2025, with nearly absolute certainty. 1) Donald Trump will be out of office. 2) The price of one #bitcoin will be at least $160,000.https://t.co/VzVOCjuxE2 pic.twitter.com/x1BOCqkm3s — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredcrypto) July 12, 2019  What do you think of Peterson’s analysis?

The company’s total net revenue for the second quarter grew 44% from one year ago. One of the revenue areas contributing to Square’s results was Bitcoin.  According to the company’s earnings report, adjusted revenue increased to $562.8 million during the quarter ending June 30, 2019. A year ago, the company reported revenues of $385.4 million.  A company letter announcing the financial results highlighted that the mobile payment service Cash App has “millions of engaged customers.” It also pointed to Cash App as one of the key drivers for the strong revenue growth. Indeed, Cash App has grown considerably over in recent years. It generates revenue from six separate sources, which Square details as follows: 1. Instant Deposit 2. Cash Card 3. Business Accounts 4. P2P transactions funded with a credit card 5. Bitcoin 6. Interest on customers’ stored balances The letter highlights Cash App’s success, In three years, total net revenue from Cash App increased from approximately $1 million in the second quarter of 2016 to $135 million, excluding BTC, in the second quarter of 2019. Regarding revenues generated by Bitcoin, the letter notes that of the total revenue of $135 million, which includes subscription and services-based revenue as well as transaction-based, $125 million was Bitcoin-generated revenue. The letter specifies, During the quarter, Bitcoin revenue benefited from increased volume as a result of the increase in the price of Bitcoin, and generated $2 million of gross profit. In 2018, Square enhanced Cash App to facilitate Bitcoin trading. In this regard, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey obtained a New York BitLicense on June 18, 2018. The BitLicense allows Square to offer Bitcoin trading services in New York via its Cash app. Square’s CEO is a Bitcoin visionary. In 2018, according to The Times, Jack Dorsey predicted, “Bitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it becomes the single global currency of the internet within a decade.” What do you think about the peer-to-peer and Bitcoin payment services offered by Square’s Cash App?

Well, now he has unleashed a new metric, the Bitcoin Difficulty Ribbon.  The ‘ribbon’ consists of several simple moving averages of mining difficulty, on timescales from 9 to 200 days. As difficulty generally goes up, the 9-day moving average will tend to be higher than the 200-day moving average. However, when the ribbon compresses or flips, this signals a slowdown in difficulty increase or even a decrease in difficulty. These are the best times to buy bitcoin, which would seem like a nice simple indicator to use. But why should it be so? Introducing the Bitcoin Difficulty Ribbon. When the ribbon compresses, or flips negative, these are the best time to buy in and get exposure to Bitcoin. The ribbon consists of simple moving averages on mining difficulty so we can easily see the rate of change in difficulty. pic.twitter.com/6kBz4sLG1d — Willy Woo (@woonomic) August 1, 2019  The visualization of mining difficulty examines the effect of mining on bitcoin’s price. Of the new coins being mined, some are sold off to cover miners production costs. This produces a downward pressure on bitcoin price. Weaker miners must sell more of their mined coins in order to remain operational until this becomes unsustainable. At this point, the weak miners give up, reducing the overall hashing power and potentially causing a difficulty drop. Only stronger miners are left, who don’t need to sell as many coins to cover costs, leaving room for more bullish price action.  Historically, this has happened at the end of bear markets. The lack of selling pressure from weaker miners (who have left the market) allows for price to stabilize and climb. A similar effect can be seen during block reward halving events when a sudden drop in the coins mined occurs, yet costs remain the same. Woo’s work builds on an April 2014 observation from Vinny Lingham, CEO of Civic. One observation that Woo makes is that the current bull market (and the capitulation that preceded it) has more in common with that of 2012 than 2016. In 2016 the ribbon compressed, but in both 2012 and 2019, the ribbon fully flipped, showing severe mining capitulation. This, in turn, led to vastly reduced selling pressure from miners, and a shorter accumulation period before price breakout. The 2012 bull-run saw bitcoin price go from around $2.50 to an eventual top of over $1000. Which means (let me get my calculator)… past performance is no guarantee of future results. But it is interesting nonetheless. What do you think of Willy Woo’s Bitcoin Difficulty Ribbon Model? Let us know in the comments below! ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin mining', 'bitcoin price']"

Quedex will offer digital asset custodial services in the region and co-founder Wiktor Gromniak said:  In order for the crypto industry to mature and to welcome more institutional investors into our tent it is of the essence that we create transparent financial markets and develop sophisticated financial products, such as futures and options. The licensing process took 15 months and the exchange had to meet 9 regulatory principles before obtaining the license.

Galaxy Digital founder and chief executive Michael Novogratz today admitted that he would be worried if bitcoin’s near-term downtrend continues any further. The former hedge fund manager noted that price falling below the $8,500 level is not good news. And a close below the $6,000 is certainly worst. Will #btc ever go back to $5K? “I don’t think so.

Nevertheless, he stressed that the $5,000 level would cap the cryptocurrency from falling further. The statement appeared over a month after Novogratz had admitted selling some of his bitcoin stash around $14,000. In the same breath, he had predicted that the cryptocurrency would trend sideways in a $10,000-$14,000 range. However, the price started plummeting in early July as a part of a natural downside correction. Investors also digested the anti-crypto comments made by US President Donald Trump on July 11, followed by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s press brief, wherein he called bitcoin “a national security issue.”  Bitcoin uptrend also got punctured due to Libra hearings on the Capitol Hill. The congressional meetings saw Facebook executive David Marcus responding to sharply-pointed queries of US lawmakers. While the social media giant eventually planned to shelve its Libra cryptocurrency plans, its senate-level trial raised the selling pressure in the bitcoin market, which had already factored in the gains that came after the Libra announcement in mid-June. That somewhat explains why Novogratz, in his latest interview with CNBC, predicted the bitcoin price with caution. As usual, the Crypto Twitter was not impressed with all the nervousness. Nervous about what? If your a long term believer you want to buy when it goes on sale. Nervous? Makes no sense. You get nervous when it went up in a straight line a while back.

He discussed that the cryptocurrency does not need to put its mouth into the lion’s hunt, i.e., it should not attempt to take away the market share of the US dollar. Excerpts” “If bitcoin starts to eat away all the dollar’ [space], the Federal Reserve would be very nervous, and that’s why, I think, they are more focused on Libra or other stablecoin projects.” Instead, Novogratz added, bitcoin backers should use the “digital gold” narrative so, for regulators, the cryptocurrency becomes like any other asset they need to regulate. As for a potential bitcoin ban, Novogratz thinks the US and European governments are not thinking in that direction. Know your customer and anti-money laundering is being [really] strictly enforced here in the U.S. and Europe,” he said. “The good news is there are lots of institutional players that are coming into the space that is going to make access much easier for credible players.

Here are three likely reasons responsible for the move above $10k. For the first time in a decade, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point (0.25%). After a momentary slip, BTC above $10,000 within the space of five hours. Many commentators have argued that a rate slash by the Fed would be net positive for bitcoin. Lower interest rates usually lead to increased liquidity in the financial market — a trend that could trigger increased inflow into bitcoin. Bitcoin’s rise to a five-day high above $10,000 could be attributed to a slew of positive comments about the top-ranked crypto within the past week. Mike Crapo, chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee even said that the country couldn’t ban bitcoin. There is also some positive bitcoin news coming out of China despite the country’s ban on crypto trading and ICOs. The Bank of China recently published a mostly favorable infographic describing BTC and the reasons behind its increase in price.  The current rise above $10,000 might also be another false start for bitcoin in the Summer. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, July and August are historically lean months for BTC. Also, there have been reports of massive liquidation of longs on BitMEX, running into about $50 million. Some commentators even attributed the late July BTC flash crash to these liquidations on long positions by the exchange. Bitcoin has attempted to break above the $10,100 level on five different occasions since slipping below $11,000 in mid-July. Any tangible rally for bitcoin would require a move above this resistance point. As at press time, the crypto market as a whole has gained about $8 billion over the last 24 hours. There is the still the matter of the CME gap yet to be filled at around the $8,500 price mark. Trading volume is also significantly lower than the levels recorded in early July. Despite any short-term struggles, the bull case for bitcoin continues to remain valid with some commentators predicting a new all-time high for BTC before the end of the year. Bitcoin is up more than 170% since the start of 2019 and bulls will be hoping for a better run in August and a return to the trend of monthly gains. Do you think BTC will be able to stay above the $10,000 price level in the short term? Let us know in the comments below.

According to Google Trends, there are now more people interested in bitcoin than there are in stocks. For the first time since late 2017, bitcoin searches on Google have surpassed those for stocks. For most of 2018 when bitcoin and crypto were suffering during the bear market, searches for stocks were higher. But as BTC began to rally in April and May this year the trend flipped in the digital currency’s favour.  For the week of June 23 to 29 bitcoin eclipsed stocks with an interest of 100 compared to 58 for the traditional asset class. The average for the past month has also been in bitcoin’s territory with a score of 79 to 76. Geographically, most stock searches originate in the US and Canada and it is highly probable that people are searching for individual stocks rather than the general term. However, the trend could indicate a wider paradigm shift in interest for crypto assets as a vehicle of investment. The top five countries most interested in bitcoin over the past month are Brazil, Turkey, Nigeria, Germany and Argentina. There could be a number of fundamental factors driving this search trend. Firstly, bitcoin has been in the political limelight recently for all the wrong reasons. Facebook has clearly riled the regulators who have shone the flashlight of fear over all digital assets. Bitcoin was also mentioned by US president Trump last month in a tweet that most industry observers viewed as bullish despite the underlying negative sentiment. There is no denying that global economic woes are escalating as memories of the last financial crisis begin creeping back. Yet again the US is spearheading financial tensions with an escalating trade war with China. The fallout from that is being felt across Asia as neighboring nations begin to wonder if they will be the next target for Trump’s tariffs. Britain’s Brexit has created a cloud of economic uncertainty that has lasted over two years as infighting between inept politicians delay the process and prevent any chances of moving forward. As a result GBP has plunged to lows not seen for several years. An escalating debt problem in most developed nations may also be driving people to research bitcoin as they seek to hedge against their own currencies while fears of another financial meltdown mount.

We will know if the recent bullish breakout is sustainable within the next few days.  On the 30 minute chart for XBT/USD, we can see the recent breakout of the asymmetrical triangle highlighted by a circle at the breakout point. Since then, RSI has created ascending support that has broken to the downside, and alongside this there also appears to be descending volume. This all leads me to believe the breakout is unsustainable and price levels will likely revisit POC (Point of Control) at $9,480 in the short-term. Market price action is trading within a decision point range between $9,860 and $10,120. Depending on which way the price action takes here will determine which direction we will likely see it continue – meaning if bears pull price action below the trading range, further downside is likely to come. Adversely, if bulls break above the decision point range with clear rising volume it’s likely to price levels will progress further upwards.  On the 4 hour XBT/USD chart we can see POC remains at the same levels as on the 30 Minute, meaning that either there was a lot of buying power at the floor of the asymmetrical triangle before the breakout, or that the recent breakout is running low on petrol. Typically, if low volume occurs on a breakout whilst POC remains below the breakout point, the POC will act as a magnet pulling price action towards it. RSI remains high on the 4 hour chart with more room to progress higher as the RSI has not breached the overbought levels of 80.00 or higher. Both the 15 MA and 50 EMA are about to cross over each other as they progress through the overhead resistance of the previous triangle. Moving averages crossing over each other in a bullish fashion in conjunction with a trading pattern breakout typically is a strong sign of a new trend forming. There’s a mixture of bearish and bullish indications from today’s analysis on Bitcoin. Whichever direction price action goes in comparison to the decision point range will provide is with further clarification as to which indications I’ve picked up from analysing Bitcoin will come to fruition.

One sign of growing adoption and usage is BTC transactions which are higher this year than ever before. While the price has retreated almost 30% from its 2019 high, bitcoin transactions are constantly rising and are on track to make this year the highest in its history. The chart was plotted by Canadian bitcoin trading portal, Shakepay, noting that total daily transactions are now over 350k.

When in doubt, zoom out. pic.twitter.com/27eJrfPVt3 — Shakepay – Buy/Sell Bitcoin 🇨🇦 (@shakepay) July 31, 2019  According to Bitinfocharts, BTC transactions peaked in mid-December 2017 when they hit 490k. This also correlates with the $20k price peak which occurred around the same time. The second high was in early May this year when it topped 450k. Currently daily bitcoin transactions are at 360k but the cumulative total for the year is higher than previous. There are other indications that these metrics are bullish and on the up. According to crypto trader going by the twitter handle ‘Ceteris Paribus’, citing a chart from Messari, bitcoin averaged almost $800k in daily transaction fees over the past month. $BTC averaged $795K in daily transaction fees over the past 30 days. After the $LTC halving next week, this will be more than the new issuance for every coin outside of $ETH. $BTC averaged $795K in daily transaction fees over the past 30 days.

Measure of success as a settlement layer: https://t.co/j9LAXPaArn — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) July 31, 2019  Another measure of network health is hashrate which hit a new all-time high a couple of days ago. Charts reveal that BTC hashrate was a fraction below 79 EH/s on July 29 which is its highest ever level. The high hashrate is good for miners as it increases their chances of sealing off the block and reaping the reward. With both network horsepower and transactions constantly rising, the system becomes more secure with growing usage and adoption. It is just a matter of time and the price will only follow as a new bitcoin ATH is expected soon. Will BTC break its price high this year? Add your thoughts below.

Only it has no shares, no shareholders or governance,” he wrote.  “Taken together, all the other (100 largest) cryptocurrencies are worth just under $100 billion, with 14 of them worth over $1 billion.” Franco chaired the Brazilian Central Bank twice in the mid and late 1990s and has since become a private investor via his new company, Rio Bravo Investimentos. His comments strike an immediate chord with Bitcoin advocates, who are used to central bankers pouring scorn on decentralized financial offerings.  As Bitcoinist noted, that scorn has taken various forms, from caution to concern to outright anger.  This month, it was the turn of China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), to voice worries over the potential role of Libra in particular. A stablecoin, Facebook says Libra will be pegged to a basket of fiat currencies, but China foresees complications if the US dollar takes precedence.  “If [Libra] is widely used for payments, cross-border payments in particular, would it be able to function as money and accordingly have a large influence on monetary policy, financial stability, and the international monetary system?” Wang Xin, director of the PBoC’s research bureau said last month. For Franco, however, Libra, despite lacking the advantages of decentralization, still represents the power of non-banking players. For him, any major corporation could follow Facebook.  “In theory, however, any global company, even without being big tech, could do something similar,” he continued. “McDonald’s could create the Mac, a Big Mac convertible cryptocurrency. Starbucks, the Star, working as a ‘cappuccino voucher,’ all on the blockchain. Why not?” In fact, Starbucks is already keenly eyeing the space, notably through its involvement with newly-launched institutional trading platform Bakkt.  McDonald’s still has a way to go, having trialled a real-life MacCoin last year but admitting it was not in fact a cryptocurrency at all.  What do you think about Gustavo Franco’s perspective on Bitcoin?

That was the conclusion from Anthony ‘Pomp’ Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital and a serial Bitcoin proponent, during the cryptocurrency world’s latest public showdown on July 31. In a private debate on CNBC Africa with host Ran Neuner, Pomp listened to almost an hour of Schiff explaining gold’s benefits and how Bitcoin would never ultimately have genuine value.  “If people are right about what’s going to happen to Bitcoin, all the people who own it are going to be really rich, and that’s a dream people don’t want to let go of,” he summarized.  Continuing, Schiff said crypto investors have been “sidetracked by the own greed” and that Bitcoin had become a form of religion. “When you live in a bubble, you can’t see the bubble,” he concluded.   Pompliano had previously sparred with Schiff multiple times on social media, even orchestrating a donation campaign earlier this month which saw him inadvertently become the owner of 0.21 BTC.  This time, however, he delivered a stark vision of the future, in which gold bugs were on the losing end compared to Bitcoin. Statistically, he argued, that scenario was likely.  “If Peter and others believe… with 100% confidence there is 0% you could be wrong, you could be missing something; 0% chance that Bitcoin could be valuable, that it could be a new technology, a new trend… don’t buy it, don’t put it in your portfolio, don’t use it,” he began.  “But if there is even a 1% chance that you could be wrong, the odds, given that it is an asymmetric asset, means that you will be kicking yourself forever for having known about this, spending your time doing this, getting berated on the internet and missed the opportunity.” Pompliano’s angle echoed that of another major investor this week in the form of Raoul Pal, the ex-Goldman Sachs executive who described Bitcoin as being potentially “ludicrously undervalued.” Similarly talking about Bitcoin the asymmetric asset, Pal argued that even if there is a 1% chance of Bitcoin succeeding as an alternative financial system, it’s market cap could skyrocket beyond what people are willing to imagine. “So even if there’s a 1% chance of working… what it’s telling you is (Bitcoin is) ludicrously underpriced if any of these probabilities play out,” he said on the Stephan Livera Podcast.

Titled ‘Understanding Cryptocurrency Holders in Europe,’ the report explored personalities of the men and women who hold cryptocurrencies as a part of their portfolio. It found that about 54% of the European cryptocurrency investors did not have a university degree; including 30% who only attended school until age 18, 5% who have done the same until age 16, and 19% who have taken a trading/technical course or at least have a college diploma. Nevertheless, it is the age of an average bitcoin investor that takes the cake. People in their 16s and late 24s make up to 27% of the overall European cryptocurrency holder. On the other hand, people between the age group of 25 and 34 are 33% – the highest in the lot. Senior citizens are not behind either, with 5% of them holding some form of cryptocurrency – let’s hope bitcoin – in their investment portfolio.

Nevertheless, Swiss excels somewhere else in the study. Excerpts: As a wealthy country with a large concentration of the professions, we would associate with greater cryptocurrency ownership – as well as a large, well-developed financial services sector. it should come as no surprise that Switzerland has the highest rate of cryptocurrency ownership in Europe and among the highest in the world.

However, in theory, there does exist a handful of ways to kill Bitcoin. Yesterday, the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs discussed blockchain and cryptocurrency regulation. Chairman Mike Crapo suggested that it would be almost impossible for the US to ban Bitcoin. He stated: If the United States were to decide — and I’m not saying that it should — if the United States were to decide we don’t want cryptocurrency to happen in the United States and tried to ban it, I’m pretty confident we couldn’t succeed in doing that because this is a global innovation. Earlier this month, Congressman Patrick McHenry told CNBC that there was no capacity to kill Bitcoin. Indeed, the creator (creators) of Bitcoin anticipated the potential interference from governments. The technology underpinning it – blockchain – involves a global network of millions of nodes, which makes the cryptocurrency almost indestructible as soon as the Internet lives. When it comes to Facebook’s Libra, the US government has much more control and can stop its launch. But even if it goes live, Libra’s blockchain will be a permissioned version involving only 100 nodes that represent big corporations. However, in theory, Bitcoin is not infallible, and some governments have the potential to ban citizens from using it. Countries with a less developed internet infrastructure could simply shut down the web. Last month, Sudan saw an internet blackout that carried on for weeks. The government deliberately cut off the Internet to stifle local protests, but it can apply the same tactic to prohibit the use of cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, such drastic moves are possible with autocratic governments only. The US would never consider such tactics. Instead, if the US establishment really considered Bitcoin a threat, they would simply buy it. Yes – that’s right. Think about it – American economists and cryptography experts always simulate various emerging phenomena to forecast their potential directions and impact. James Rickards explains in his book “Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis,” how he took part in currency war simulations in a broader program by the US government to understand the potential impact of various monetary strategies. It’s hard to believe that the US government and intelligence agencies didn’t understand the potential of Bitcoin. The FBI seized the Silk Road as early as 2013, so the US government knew about the threat of a decentralized currency. If it really wanted to kill Bitcoin, the government could just buy all the available coins through its agents, as the market cap at that time was only $1 billion. The US can use the same trick even today, even though the market cap is now more than $175 billion. If you take out the lost coins and those owned by hodlers, the government would only need around $100 billion to stop this “threat” called Bitcoin. In 2008, the US spent over $700 billion for the bank bailout, while the Fed spent trillions for its quantitative easing programs (Q1, Q2, Q3). So why is Bitcoin still there? Well, because the US government doesn’t actually mind it. Maybe Bitcoin came from the sincere intention to damage the traditional finance, but in reality, it helps the US dollar cope with its inflation in a shift to a new financial system revolving around digital money issued by central banks. The USD has the status of the world reserve currency. Up until 1971, the American currency was backed by gold with the price of $35 per troy ounce, as per The Bretton Woods Agreement. It didn’t stop the Fed from printing out money out of thin air though, but the US always knew how to export inflation (mainly through generous grants like the Marshall Plan initiative). After the Nixon shock in 1971, the US dollar became a free-floating currency, as the gold standard was removed. However, the US reached some agreements with Saudi Arabia (and other OPEC countries) to sell its oil exclusively in USD. This helped the American currency secure global demand, which enabled it to continue to print money out of thin air and buy everything cheap or at no cost at all. Those who openly dared to sell their oil for other currencies rather than USD ended badly. The point is this – periodically, the US needs a new market to export its dollar inflation. In other words, it has to secure USD demand to continue printing money without devaluing its currency. The collapse of the USSR, along with different wars here and there allowed the US to flood virgin markets with its paper money. Bitcoin is another such market that attracts billions of US dollars. Thus, it helps the US write off part of the inflation. The Fed continues to print money without end. Meanwhile, as crypto-analyst Willy Woo figured out, institutional investment negatively impacts Bitcoin price action. The fact that only a few hands control the coin’s supply doesn’t make Bitcoin a good means of exchange.  However, this might be the final phase of the show, as the world is moving towards digital currencies indeed. On Sunday, Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), told Financial Times that central banks would issue digital currencies sooner than we think. The central banks have anticipated the shift long ago. Bitcoin is helping the US dollar endure the transformation smoother and give people the illusion that they can actually outsmart the global elite.

If you recreate a low probability of, let’s say, what’s the global money supply and global debt? It’s something like, I don’t know, call it 80 trillion dollars or something,” he said.  “…So if it’s worth 80 trillion dollars, let’s say you have a 10% probability, that’s 8 trillion dollars. It’s currently worth 200 billion dollars. So even if there’s a 1% chance of working… what it’s telling you is (Bitcoin is) ludicrously underpriced if any of these probabilities play out.” Bitcoin has decreased its market cap in recent weeks in the wake of regulatory upheaval focused mainly on the US. At press time, the figure circled $174 billion.  As Bitcoinist reported, forecasts of a giant leap in market cap even for the short term have come thick and fast as markets stage a broad recovery this year.  In June, Arnie Hill, partner at Obsidian Capital VC Fund, said the current bull cycle alone could give way to a $1 trillion market cap. Another version of market cap, known as a realized cap, meanwhile hit an all-time high in July despite BTC/USD prices shrinking since Hill’s prediction. For Pal, the allure of Bitcoin’s potential forms an irresistible opportunity for major investors and institutions.  “So that’s how crazy attractive it is, and that’s why it’s sucking in so many of these macro guys, because they’re like, ‘Damn, nothing else has this payoff,’” he continued. This week meanwhile saw regular statistics compiler Willy Woo explain that recent bullish action came almost exclusively from such institutional interest. The main phase of the bull run, in longer terms, has yet to even begin.  “…Mainly it was a cascade of short squeezes from quant fund activity that setup this rally,” he theorized on Twitter.  “Long term investor buying during the rally has been small-ticket retail money; the true organically fueled bull season hasn’t started yet.” What do you think about Raoul Pal’s Bitcoin market cap theory?

Traders question the sustainability of this recent breakout as volume levels remain low. On the 1 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see the attempted breakout as the current market price breaches through the overhead resistance forming a clear asymmetrical triangle. It’s important to note that volume has remained fairly low throughout this attempted breakout so a failure to gain or re-test of $9,600 is likely. There’s a lot of resting buying orders in the market between $9,600 and $$9,130 meaning a significant amount of selling pressure from bears would be needed in order for levels to break below this market range. RSI has been clearly ascending over the last 48 hours which could be a bullish sign or a step towards bearish divergence. We know if RSI stays above 60.00 over the next few days that bulls are in control and a new, more sustainable, uptrend could result from the asymmetrical triangle bullish breakout. However, is RSI drops below this level then it’s likely that momentum will shift back towards 30.00 – 20.00 resulting in a further downside movement. RSI is often overlooked or over-complicated. Key support lies between $9,130 and $8,820. Key meaning if this level is broken to the downside the short-term trend and consensus will no longer be bullish, and a return back to POC around $7,900 on the higher time frames would be a realistic pull-back target. More information on this can be found in a  previous analysis on BTC. On the 1 day chart for XBT/USD, we can see RSI sitting just above 40.00 with some clear sideways development since the drop at the end of June. This, in conjunction with the fact the POC (Point of Control) on the daily sits at $11,300 and $7,700 on the 4 Hour chart, shows that BTC is in a period of consolidation and could be leading up towards another big move. As mentioned above, the short-term trend remains bullish until $8,800 is broken. 15 EMA and 50 MA are currently touching each other for the first time in months, which again is a clear sign of consolidation ahead of a big move as the current market price trades just a few % below each moving averages price level. Key support levels to look out for are $9,130, $8,800, $8,100, $7,500 if BTC decides to drop as a result of this period of consolidation.

According to the latest instalment of the rankings, which the CCID Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China publishes regularly, Bitcoin came in 11th place. The CCID began issuing periodic rankings of major cryptocurrencies in 2018, and currently includes 37 tokens in its evaluations.  Each scores points in three categories: ‘basic tech,’ ‘applicability’ and ‘creativity,’ to obtain an overall ‘total index’ value. The results have sparked controversy from the outset, as the CCID appeared to favour Chinese Blockchain projects over decentralized alternatives – including the ‘original’ cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Wednesday’s indices were no different, with the top spot going to domestic platform EOS, which scored a total of 153.1 points. Bitcoin, by comparison, scored 103. Second place belonged to Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market cap, which achieved a total index score of 148.6. The other three spaces in the top five went to Tron, NULS and GXchain. Tron scored third highest despite the ongoing drama surrounding its creator, Justin Sun, who reports claim is under investigation by authorities over his business practises.  The CCID data comes as China-based cryptocurrency entities hit the headlines abroad this week. Long associated with the Bitcoin mining sector, the country appears set to lose ground to the US after major player Canaan Creative reportedly filed to undergo an initial public offering (IPO) in the country.  The move, which is still unofficial, follows similar noises from competitor Bitmain, which hinted it was pursuing a similar process last month.  Both companies had tried and failed to launch an IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange late last year, at a time when the Bitcoin mining industry was suffering as BTC/USD hit $3100. Authorities in Beijing are already wary of Facebook’s Libra stablecoin, which central bank officials earlier warned could have a detrimental effect on the Chinese economy if it were too closely pegged to the US dollar.  A homegrown alternative could ultimately launch in future, the same sources said, something which the head of tech giant Huawei reiterated this week.  “China can just issue our own version of Libra. Why should we wait for others to do it? The power of a country is always stronger than that of an Internet company,” said at a press conference in Italy.

Libra got another bashing, and Chairman, Mike Crapo, surmised the U.S. “couldn’t succeed” in banning Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies even if it wanted to.  Crapo introduced the hearing on a positive note for crypto, noting that although the hearings had started by examining Libra, the cryptocurrency ecosystem was diverse, saying: It seems to me that these technologies and other digital innovations are inevitable. They could be beneficial… and I believe the US should lead in their development. I look forward to hearing more about the ecosystem during this hearing. His colleague, Senator Sherrod Brown, continued that previous hearings had left serious concerns about Facebook’s plan to ‘run its own currency out of a Swiss Bank Account’. Questions put to Calibra head, David Marcus had been dodged, proving again that Facebook doesn’t understand accountability. According to Brown, Facebook cannot be trusted as it just doesn’t care, preferring to ‘move fast and break things’. “Now it wants to break our currency and payment systems hiding behind the phrase innovation,” Brown said. We should be a little suspicious when someone tells us that only big corporations can be trusted to provide critical public services. One thing agreed on by all the panellists was that the current U.S. Banking system is not working for everyone. High fees for basic services like ATMs, lack of real-time payment processing, and minimum balance requirements, mean 25% of U.S. Citizens are unbanked or underbanked. Circle CEO, Jeremy Allaire, opined that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency could address this imbalance, and help to create a financial system with equal opportunity for everyone. Law Professor, Mehra Baradaran, however, suggested that financial exclusion was not the result of faulty technology, but faulty policy. She claimed that the U.S. Federal Reserve had the power to fix the banking system straight away, without the need for cryptocurrency. Whilst this may well be true, it was somewhat off the topic for the hearing. Allaire said that the current uncertainty over regulation in the U.S. was leading the country to a significant loss of opportunity. Examples such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) using the seventy-year-old Howey Test, to determine the nature of 21st century digital assets, has had a serious impact on US companies. Many digital assets do not easily fit into the classifications that are currently defined in the financial system. They are not entirely either currency, commodity, or investment, and some have features of all three. New regulation is needed , he continued, and it was important for this regulation to distinguish between the types of digital asset. Contradicting this, Baradaran claimed that these digital assets are not new products, just delivered with new technology. Therefore they could be dealt with using existing regulation. She then undermined this argument by saying that ‘to an extent the asset fits the currency model, or the security model, so we enforce those rules’. But gave no indication of which rules we enforce when an asset fits both (or more) models. The hearing then went on to discuss more crypto-friendly jurisdictions, as Allaire’s Circle is moving its core non-U.S. business to Bermuda. As an example for why this might be, Allaire pointed to the SEC’s extremely narrow view of what isn’t a security. It is the coupling of utility with financial worth which makes certain digital assets innovative, and if treated as a security, the utility cannot function. Therefore, companies creating such products would move operations elsewhere and perhaps even block U.S. citizens and companies from accessing products and technologies. International Trade and Finance Specialist, Dr Rebecca M Nelson, assured the Committee that crypto-positive jurisdictions were not about shirking regulation, but about providing clarity. This was not the wild west; risks are controlled, but definitions are clear, whereas the U.S. had a lot of great areas. Crapo then pondered the logistics of an attempt to ban cryptocurrency in the United States: I’m not saying that it should, but… If the United States were to decide it didn’t want cryptocurrency to happen in the United States and tried to ban it… I’m pretty confident we couldn’t succeed in doing that because it is a global innovation. However, he was interested in how a company would get around such a ban, or what methods it might use. To which Allaire pointed out that digital assets exist everywhere the internet exists. Any ban could only apply to U.S. companies trying to work in the space, and could not be enforced on the assets themselves. What do you make of these latest comments on Bitcoin?

On Monday, July 29, crypto analysis firm Coinmetrics published a report that compares Bitcoin with its main forks, BCH and BSV. The latter ones came out to solve the deviation of Bitcoin’s primary use case. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap has become a store of value, while it was designed to be used as peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash. Both BCH and BSV increased the block size to incorporate more transactions into a single block, which eventually led to lower fees. While these features permit more flexibility, neither of the two forks has enjoyed the same popularity and adoption as Bitcoin. Moreover, BTC is more often as a means of exchange, despite the transaction time and fees. Bitcoin’s realized cap is almost $100 billion. On the other side, the realized cap of BCH and BSV is below $10 billion and about $1 billion, respectively. For those unfamiliar, realized cap is a market cap-like metric that excludes coins that might be lost.  Thus, Bitcoin’s size is more than ten times bigger than BCH and one hundred times bigger than BSV. Both forks have an average transaction fee of zero USD as of today. BTC’s fee declined to $0.03 early this year, though it has maintained between $1 and $3 over the last months.  Despite everything, the fees don’t help much. Moreover, almost zero fees have a negative side, as they will leave miners with smaller rewards when block reward issuance drops. In addition, BSV and BCH have also deviated from their purpose of acting as a medium of exchange, as more transactions are used to store data on blockchain for various purposes. Often, there is no related economic transaction whatsoever. On BSV’s network, 94% of OP_RETURN transactions derive from a single weather app called WeatherSV. The Bitcoin SV fork actually removed the size limit on OP_RETURN messages. Thus, the share of BSV transactions with OP_RETURN is increasing day by day.  The same is true about Bitcoin Cash ABC:  In conclusion, despite the lower fees and greater block size, BCH and BSV cannot compete with BTC at the moment. The forks don’t even use that extra block space most of the times. BCH and BSV often act as a data storage instrument rather than a medium of exchange.

We’re going to provide rules, we’re going to give you clarity and we want these companies here – we want the innovation, we want the entrepreneurs to come in,’” Pompliano explained. Which country will embrace Bitcoin first?? 👀 Had fun on @SquawkCNBC with @andrewrsorkin @MelissaLeeCNBC @JoeSquawk @Melt_Dem and @elerianm this morning. Give them each a follow! pic.twitter.com/Ic3XD5osIe — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 30, 2019  As Bitcoinist has previously reported, Singapore remains one of the most developed jurisdictions for crypto businesses worldwide.  Authorities sought to give innovation more room for maneuver early on, with state-sponsored implementations of blockchain in particular already slated for a major rollout next year.  Specifically, Project Ubin, a joint effort by Singapore’s central bank and industry players, focuses on payments and securities clearance using so-called distributed ledger technology (DLT).  Pompliano meanwhile has become increasingly vocal about his Bitcoin support online in recent months, taking the cause to some of its other naysayers such as gold bug Peter Schiff.  By contrast, Demirors was less optimistic about the prospect of even proactive regulation. Bitcoin, she argued, was designed to eliminate middlemen who exercised unfair control over the system, but the industry is now ironically hoping those same middlemen will permit them to operate under their terms.  “What the United States is saying is that you can have Bitcoin so long as you play by our rules,” she countered. Referencing this week’s scandal involving a hacker stealing the data of 100 million US customers at credit card provider Capital One, Demirors added that even ‘on-side’ actors such as cryptocurrency exchanges – notably US leader Coinbase – fall under the same ‘middleman’ tag. She continued: “…This whole movement is about eliminating our dependence on intermediaries… we see large scale systemic risk coming from these large institutions and so the idea of Bitcoin doing away with these intermediaries is a good one, but we’ve become more and more dependent on intermediaries than ever.” In the current climate, governments worldwide remain highly varied in their treatment of cryptocurrency, with India this month announcing it is among the few considering outright criminalization of its use.

On the daily BTC/USD chart we can see how Bitcoin has made 4 lower lows over the past 20 days and found reliable support twice at the $9,400 level. By connecting these points, we can see that a bearish descending triangle has formed which paints a less than favourable picture for the asset going into the rest of this week. Right now, Bitcoin price 00 has effectively reached consolidation in between these two pinching levels which typically means that a breakout to the downside is imminent. Looking at trading volume, we can see that progressively fewer trades have been taking place since BTC entered the descending triangle, and that candles have been increasingly bearish. Looking across across to other indicators, it’s clear that the RSI has also become tightly range bound as volatility slackens off, and the 10MA has now bearishly crossed beneath the 50MA. From this it looks likely that Bitcoin bears will break the $9,400 support soon and eye new monthly lows, potentially around the $8,788 and $8,248 supports below. When we look at the monthly BTC/USD chart, we can see further bearish signals appear. After tomorrow, we will begin a new monthly candle on the chart. Unless bullish traders are able to miraculously drive BTC back up to the monthly open at $10,760 – over 11% from its current market price – then Bitcoin will close in the red for the first time since January this year. This could potentially signal to traders that the 2019 bull market has cooled off and is now starting to heavily correct. According to historical data featured in a Bitcoinist article last month, this would actually make a lot of sense given that August is renowned to be the worst time of the year for Bitcoin. Since 2010, BTC price has fallen around 14% during the 8th month which, from its current price, would mean that we could see Bitcoin decline as far as $8,300 over the next 4 weeks. Despite this bearish outlook, the lagging MACD indicator does appear to be favourably bullish right now with a positive MA convergence and buying volume increasing on the histogram. This seems to suggest that the overall trend still remains positive even though the price seems primed for a correction soon. Where do you think Bitcoin price is heading over the next 4 weeks?

Monday (July 29, 2019) turned out to be an eventful day in the bitcoin scene. “Fiach_Dubh” a pseudonymous writer for Coinmonks – a technology-focused publication – has woven an intricate plot that ties together several of the major happenings from Monday. In a Medium post published on Tuesday (July 30, 2019), the Coinmonks writer alleged that yesterday’s massive BTC movement and the launch of Tether on the Liquid Network are part of an elaborate scheme. Tweeting on Monday, Whale Alert, a Twitter bot that tracks large crypto transactions, revealed five massive bitcoin movements. Each transaction was worth more than $448 million in bitcoin making a total of $2.27 billion. As reported by Bitcoinist, Tether also went live on the Liquid Network leading to the emergence of L-USDT. This announcement happened a few minutes after the third BTC transfer. The Coinmonks article theorized that Tether is the ‘Unknown Owner 26’ involved in the $2.27 billion transfer. For the writer, the timing of these seemingly separate occurrences goes beyond simple coincidence. The argument put forward suggests that Tether plans to expand its stablecoin by taking a significant portion of the USDT market capitalization into the Liquid Network. By so doing, the writer argues that Tether can now obscure the issuance of USDT. Such a conclusion creates the possibility for private stablecoin transfers, creating a “dark pool” for exchanges. Bitcoinist reached out to both Tether and Blockstream about these theories. In an email to Bitcoinst, Blockstream CEO Samson Mow said: The theory doesn’t really hold any water because the issuance of Liquid Tether can be tracked in any Liquid Block Explorer. For example https://blockstream.info/liquid/asset/ce091c998b83c78bb71a632313ba3760f1763d9cfcffae02258ffa9865a37bd2 So, at the time I’m writing this, you can see 61 500 Liquid USDt has been issued. Mow also debunked the idea of a dark exchange pool saying Liquid’s privacy features only ensure the security of entities sending large funds. Thus, while blockchain monitoring platforms can’t view such transactions, the aim is to provide privacy, rather than anything untoward. Bitcoinist is yet to hear back from Tether as at press time. What do you think about the argument put forward that Tether wants to use the Liquid Network to obscure the issuance of USDT? Let us know in the comments below.

Millions of dollars worth of USDT are being used every day to sidestep strict capital controls for remittances back to China. OTC trading desks in Moscow are doing a roaring trade selling crypto, most of which finds its way back to China. But only 20% of sales are in Bitcoin, the rest are in stable coin, Tether (USDT). The trade comes from a constant flow of Chinese merchants, carrying bags of Rubles to exchange, made selling cheap important items on the grey market. Tether has seen most use as a temporary hedge against bitcoin price drops, and to expedite arbitrage opportunities. However, the Chinese merchants of Moscow find it has the ideal properties for their needs,and has allegedly been buying an estimated $10 million to $30 million daily, according to other news sources. Tether has no limits on transaction size, and comes without the risk of volatility that besets Bitcoin. Before the crash in 2018, merchants actually were using BTC, and speculating on price rises giving a further boost to profits. But in the current climate, the USDT stablecoin provides a preferable option. More importantly, China imposes strict capital controls, limiting foreign currency purchases to $50,000 a year. Whilst additional quota can be applied for, grey market merchants are unlikely to risk exposing the scale of their businesses. Thus, cryptocurrency (and specifically Tether) is becoming a favoured method of bypassing such regulation. Critics have long questioned Tether’s assurance that it was 100% backed by the US Dollar. Recent allegations by the New York Attorney General (that Tether illegally loaned $850 million of its Dollar reserve to Bitfinex) may seem to vindicate this. But this doesn’t seem to concern the traders and merchants of Moscow. They believe that USDT will remain liquid based on the habits and trust of its users. Besides, Tether moves fast – around 400% of market cap is traded every day. The overnight Ruble trade will be converted into Yuan by the morning. So rather than questioning whether Moscow merchants are right to trust Tether, maybe we should be looking at other potential use cases which would open up if we can trust Tether? If the NYAG’s case against Bitfinex and Tether doesn’t stand, then maybe that could happen sooner than we think. What do you think of Tether’s latest use case?

As a Twitter discussion which began July 29 revealed, Schiff, who is well known as a cryptocurrency skeptic, claimed Bitcoin’s 2019 bull run produced lower volumes than the previous one in December 2017.  “If Bitcoin really is gaining in popularity, why was volume on the most recent rally so much lower than during the 2017 rally?” he wrote.  “If interest and adoption have peaked, so too has price. That’s why this rally peaked so far below the 2017 high, and why the 2019 low will not hold!”  If Bitcoin really is gaining in popularity, why was volume on the most recent rally so much lower than during the 2017 rally?  If interest and adoption have peaked, so too has price.  That's why this rally peaked so far below the 2017 high, and why the 2019 low will not hold! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 28, 2019  Schiff’s suspicions quickly raised eyebrows among commentators. As Bitcoinist reported, the past weeks have in fact seen daily Bitcoin network volumes hit repeated all-time highs.  Financial counsellor Phillip Kennedy was the first to counter the accusations, linking to volume statistics from monitoring resource CoinMarketCap. July volumes, he noted, were 300% higher than those of December 2017.  Schiff then countered with data from Blockchain.com, which provides limited volume calculations presenting a much lower daily level. Another user noted that calculations would become increasingly difficult as more transaction activity moved off-chain to arenas such as the Lightning Network.  “This is true also,” statistics compiler and commentator Willy Woo responded.  He said that the 2019 Bitcoin price rally was driven by institutional moves and was therefore not designed to endure, something which will change in future.   “…Mainly it was a cascade of short squeezes from quant fund activity that setup (sic) this rally. Long term investor buying during the rally has been small ticket retail money; the true organically fueled (sic) bull season hasn’t started yet,” he added. Woo had previously forecast 2020 as sparking a more “sustainable bull drive” which would take markets much higher on the back of genuine consumer adoption.  Schiff meanwhile has opted not to embrace Bitcoin despite the best efforts of existing users. As Bitcoinist noted, last month, a Twitter initiative saw 112 people donate BTC to Schiff in a bid to make him change his mind. Schiff said he would ‘HODL’ the funds, which total 0.21 BTC, but now appears to have stayed firmly bearish about Bitcoin’s future. “For me price is not the issue,” he said responding to Kennedy.  “The price going up does not make me wrong. It’s just means more buyers are getting it wrong.” What do you think about Peter Schiff and Willy Woo’s comments? Let us know in the section below!

As of July 30, Bitcoin’s total market cap is at $169 billion, according to Coinmarketcap data. The dominance level maintains above 64%, demonstrating that Bitcoin is still the boss in the cryptocurrency market. However, if it were a company, Bitcoin would be on the 50th place. According to the Forbes Global 2000 list, which includes 2,000 largest public companies in the world, Apple was the largest company as of May 5, 2019. The iPhone maker boasted a market cap figure at $961.3 billion, followed by Microsoft and Amazon with $946.5 billion and $916.1 billion, respectively. Each of these three companies is about six times larger than Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency would be placed on the 50th position in the Forbes list, between HSBC Group ($175.5 billion) and Citigroup ($161.1 billion). The situation has changed as of July when most of the companies already presented their financial reports for the second quarter. Thus, Microsoft outperformed Apple and is the only one to exceed the $1 trillion mark as of today. In the updated list, which can be seen on Value Today website, Bitcoin would be on the 49th place. It would follow PetroChina ($172.5 billion) and precede HSBC Group ($168.9 billion). Bitcoin’s market cap peaked at over $232 billion in July. That figure would have helped the cryptocurrency be the 26th largest company as per the Forbes Global 2000 list. All in all, this comparison shows that the crypto market accounts for only a tiny fraction of the stock market. The total value of all the companies listed on stock exchanges around the world was $68.6 trillion in 2018, according to World Bank data.  The market cap of the entire crypto market is $264 billion as of today. This suggests that the size of the crypto space is only 0.38% of the global stock market. We used dots to visualize the sizes of the crypto industry, Bitcoin, and stock markets.  Nevertheless, this discrepancy shouldn’t surprise you. First of all, the crypto space is still at its nascent stage. Secondly, it means that the industry has much room for growth. Crypto is already outperforming the stock market by a mile.

Is it due to the ongoing CFTC investigation?  His disappearance coincides with a probe launched by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against BitMEX. The US futures regulator is investigating whether or not BitMEX offered its crypto derivatives services to American citizens. Bloomberg reported on July 19 that the probe is underway. Meanwhile, Hayes is offline since July 11. The story is the same for BitMEX’s official social media handles. The last time the Seychelles firm was active on Twitter was on July 15. It went silent, just like its CEO, after that. The mystery surrounding Hayes’ and BitMEX’s unannounced sabbatical from Twitter and CFTC’s investigation has jittered its clients. Long before Bloomberg broke the story, traders had started withdrawing their cryptocurrencies from BitMEX cold wallets. On July 13, BitMEX held about 195,000 BTC in storage. The figure dropped to near 173,000 BTC by July 26, indicating the exchange processed large withdrawals in the said period. BitMEX Volume Statistics | Image Credits: Skew Many saw those withdrawals as normal, noting BitMEX and other cryptocurrency exchanges typically see large money transfers off their platform. Volumes on San Francisco-based Coinbase exchange, for instance, had dropped by 54 percent as of July 23 –  after the CFTC announced investigations. In the same timespan, volumes on BitMEX dropped by 51 percent. Bitmex bitcoin volumes have dropped 42% since last week's CFTC news (as measured by volume's 4 day moving average). — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) July 23, 2019  But that still does not explain why Hayes and BitMEX went mum on Twitter. Hayes, in particular, was super active before July 11 as he distributed clips and eventually the full video of his debate with noted economist Nouriel Roubini. In the discussion, the two exchanged vulgar comments against each other, with Roubini calling Hayes scammer, inside traders, and whatnot, for offering 100x leverage to unaccredited investors. Roubini also alleged that BitMEX openly offered it’s crypto derivative services to customers in the US. He recalled an incident about some New York students who lost their education loan to BitMEX’s highly-leveraged betting services, adding: “If the price moves even in 0.5%, you are wiped out of your position and guess what? There is a nice tweet called ‘BitMEX Rekt.’ […] Every other second somebody has been liquidated by these guys and thousands of them have gone into financial ruin. Of course, this thing is not regulated anywhere. It is set up in Seychelles.” Roubini still asserts that Hayes belongs to prison. Nevertheless, even his provocative profile-tagging of BitMEX CEO has not been able to yield any response. Will the real Arthur Hayes please stand up?  ","['Arthur Hayes', 'BitMEX', 'CFTC']"

Bitcoin is currently trialing new temporary lows, but Squawk Box’s Joe Kernen seems to expect the BTC price to surge to $55,000 by May 2020. While co-hosting Squawk Box on July 29, Kernen asked the program guest Katie Stockton, founder, and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, whether she anticipated the coin to hit the $55,000 mark. Kernen acted as if he agreed with this level and wondered if Stockton expected the same. Will bitcoin reach $55k by May 2020? @JoeSquawk discusses #btc with @StocktonKatie pic.twitter.com/r1b5rNhX1s — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) July 29, 2019  Kernen associates the potential bullish rally with the next halving of Bitcoin, which is estimated to occur at around May 2020. When that happens, miners will receive 6.25 BTC per block instead of 12.5. Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto established this approach in order to make BTC a deflationary asset, capping the maximum supply at 21 million coins. The last halving took place on July 9, 2016, on the block 420,000. At that point, the block reward fell 50%, from 25 BTC to the current level at 12.5 BTC. The halving was preceded by a sharp rally that started in June 2016. After a short-term correction, the market gradually updated its record levels up until late 2017, when the price hit the $20,000 level on several exchanges. In a similar fashion, the upcoming halving might drive the Bitcoin market to new records. It is because the halving will directly affect the supply. Judging by the reaction of Stockton, she initially thought that Kernen was joking. The Squawk Box co-host then delivered several fundamental analysis arguments that seemed reasonable and plausible. The other co-hosts of the program, Andrew Ross Sorkin and Rebecca Quick, were almost laughing at Kernen’s daring prediction. Eventually, he admitted that the question to Katie Stockton was a joke. In the end, Kernen hinted that he was teasing Bitcoin believers. However, he compared Bitcoin to gold and silver, pointing to the coin’s scarcity.

As previously reported by Bitcoinist, the Supreme Court of the State of New York will resume hearing on the case between the NYAG and bitcoin exchange platform Bitfinex on Monday (July 29, 2019). A negative outcome for iFinex — the parent company of Bitfinex, could potentially open the exchange and Tether up to more lawsuits. The NYAG is accusing Bitfinex of covering up $850 million in client losses. Bitfinex, for its part, says the court lacks both personal and subject matter jurisdiction to hear the matter. The company also challenged accusations of servicing U.S. customers, saying such entities were foreign eligible contract participants (ECPs). However, some revelations emerged last Friday (July 26, 2019) which could severely damage the platform’s claim of not servicing U.S. customers. Bitfinex issued a statement on its website confirming a U.S.-based customer who managed to circumvented restrictions placed against Americans using the platform. An excerpt from the post reads: We have now identified this user. We correctly flagged this user’s IP address as being in the U.S. Notwithstanding the U.S. IP address — which may be used by Bitfinex customers, as appropriate — our system logs demonstrate that this user represented to us several times that he was not an individual resident in the U.S. This person has lied to Bitfinex on multiple occasions, deliberately and wrongly concealed his location, and flagrantly violated our terms of service. July has seen a choppy price action for bitcoin with BTC topping $13,000 and slipping below $10,000 within the space of seven days. Over the past 14 days, the top-ranked crypto has also set successive lower highs with a significant contraction in trading volume. A negative verdict in Monday’s trial could see massive exiting of USDT positions which would most likely be net positive for bitcoin price in the short run. The same could also happen to altcoins providing a temporary boost to a market that has been in the doldrums of late.

There has been no attempt at recovery from the weekend rout that resulted in BTC losing another thousand dollars. Aside from one extended wick in a flash crash on the hourly chart touching $9,120, bitcoin has remained flat for the past 24 hours. Following the big dump on Saturday BTC has consolidated around the $9,450 level and is currently trading at 00. It is currently trading below both the 50 and 200-hour moving averages according to Tradingview. This is likely to lead to further losses on this timeframe. BTC price 1-hour chart – Tradingview.com The intraday high of $9,700 was weak and there has been no further attempt to approach the five-figure resistance level again. RT anchor, Max Keiser, has eyed the liquidation of highly leveraged positions on BitMEX as a possible catalyst for further losses. #Bitcoin down as @BitMEXResearch unwinds highly leveraged positions. When I interviewed @CryptoHayes he said the avg. leverage (on a scale of 0-100x) was 20.

(@maxkeiser) July 27, 2019  Bitcoin is currently trading at the top of that range but analysts are expecting a dip into the $8,000s as the technicals are not looking favorable. Weekly losses from the same time last Monday are at 9.5% and BTC has dumped 20% since this time last month. As it stands the correction from high to yesterday’s low is at 34%. Fundamentally things are not looking too bad with a weakened dollar and an interest rate reduction expected in the US this week. These are usually bullish for bitcoin but the current correction could have further to fall before it bottoms out. As usual, the altcoin markets are shadowing their big brother and are mostly in the red during the morning’s trading session. Ethereum, while flat on the day, has now fallen below $210 as it approaches the key psychological support level at $200. XRP is back at $0.30 following news that the parent company, Ripple, has been offloading its stash of tokens. Litecoin FOMO has fizzled out with the halving just a week away now. LTC has dropped back below $90 once again with little sign of a return to previous highs. There are only a few low cap altcoins moving today as the rest continue to shed any recent gains. Crypto market capitalization has not changed much in the past 24 hours and remains at $263 billion. How low will bitcoin price fall in this correction? Add your comments below!

Now, to propel DoD’s Digital Modernization Strategy, the department, through DARPA, is starting to experiment with Bitcoin’s underlying technology: blockchain. The DoD is embarking on an effort to modernize its digital environment to gain “great power competition.” In this regard, on July 12, 2019, the department released a document titled DoD Digital Modernization Strategy. The document details a roadmap for DoD’s priorities, which include cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, cloud, and command, control and communications. It describes the importance of the strategy as follows: “This Digital Modernization Strategy is the cornerstone for advancing our digital environment to afford the Joint Force a competitive advantage in the modern battlespace.” Thus, to improve command, control, and communications, DARPA is focusing on how blockchain technology could best be used. In effect, aware of blockchain’s virtues, DARPA is starting to experiment with blockchain to build a more efficient, robust, and secure communication platform. DARPA affirms that a blockchain-based communication platform would allow the transmission of secure messages from anywhere and allow personnel to process transactions that can be traced through channels of a decentralized ledger. And it adds, “The application will be used in different ways, including facilitating communication between units and headquarters, and transmitting information between intelligence officers and the Pentagon.” Furthermore, DARPA has already been trying to develop an un-hackable code, using blockchain “because the technology offers intelligence on hackers who try to break into secure databases.” According to DoD, blockchain “inverts the cybersecurity paradigm.” DoD puts its faith in blockchains because they are trustless. And they are “transparently secure.” They do not rely on failure-prone secrets, but rather on a cryptographic data structure that makes tampering both exceptionally difficult and immediately obvious.” Moreover, they are fault-tolerant, “[Blockchains] align the efforts of honest nodes to reject those that are dishonest. As a result, blockchain networks not only reduce the probability of compromise but also impose significantly greater costs on an adversary to achieve it.” However, the United States is not the only country researching potential military-related blockchain capabilities. As Bitcoinist reported earlier, Russia and China also seem to be researching blockchain for military-related purposes, general national defense, and cyber-security.

But will Boris be bad for Bitcoin? Or perhaps cause prices to rise? Maybe Boris isn’t the answer to all our questions and we should be looking elsewhere… like the rest of the weeks news, for instance.  It would be hard to argue that bitcoin has had a great week price-wise, but neither has it been a total disaster. According to many analysts, the longer time spent in consolidation, the bigger the breakout when it comes. But that is little comfort when we are $1000 down from where we were a week ago. At the start of the week price was bubbling happily along in five figures, holding $10,500 despite low trading volume. The neutral close to the week prompted some to believe a breakout was imminent. The problem was, the breakout could just as easily be on the downside, with pressure building on $9800 support. A push down through this to $9.5k saw the bulls take control again taking the price back up into five digits. £10,000 always looked wobbly though, and price struggled to stay above this psychologically important figure. The end of the week saw a potential bearish divergence manifest, bringing a price drop towards support at $9k. Thankfully it was held in check at $9400, which seems to have steadied for the time being. Long term sentiment was still bullish however, with Mike Novogratz predicting all-time highs for 2019, and Pantera Capital going even further with a $42k prediction for this year. Following last week’s will-they won’t-they, an Indian government committee finally confirmed that it was recommending a blanket ban on all cryptocurrencies. However, it was claimed that this report was based on flawed arguments right from the very start. Tim Draper voiced concerns that if the ban were to be enforced, it could set India back 40 years. Which in tech terms is akin to the dark ages. Quite how India will ban a decentralised worldwide network of computers has not been explained. News that the US Tax Collector is hunting down thousands of bitcoin holders, caused concern this week. Thankfully there are other ways of getting one over on US authorities. US Sanctions causing you problems? Might we suggest Bitcoin to get around those? Venezuelan airports are doing just that, and it seems so effective that Russian arms manufacturers are asking the central bank to let them use Bitcoin for the same thing. Cryptocurrency also seems to be uniting the Middle East. Iran gave the green light to cryptocurrency mining in the country, and Palestine believes a sovereign cryptocurrency will free it from its reliance on the Israeli Shekel. Bitfinex hit back in court at the New York Attorney General’s claims that it serviced US customers in 2018. And ‘Wunderk**d’ Erik Finman took a free tour of the Capitol building, and pretended he was there to address congress. Facebook’s Libra got caught up in a phishing scam, whilst a recent survey found consumer sentiment had gone from apathy to mistrust. Bakkt somewhat laughably announced that it had started its much delayed User Acceptance Testing on-schedule. New York’s new crypto-licensing division may even expedite its ‘certified custodian’ status. John McAfee walked free from a Dominican jail following his arrest earlier in the week, saying he had been well treated. The arrest concerned photographs of firearms on the Freedom Boat on which McAfee has been living. If you were hoping for Warren Buffett to being praising cryptocurrency from the rooftops by now, you’re out of luck. Tron CEO Justin Sun cancelled his much-publicised charity lunch with the investor due to a case of kidney stones. In the end, the lunch was just postponed until an unspecified future date, but some questioned the validity of the kidney stones excuse. It was claimed that Sun was subject to a travel ban meaning he could not leave China. In response to which, Sun posted photos of himself in San Francisco to social media. So we’ll just have to wait for that particular meeting of the minds. What do you make of this week’s news? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!

On the 30 Minute chart for XBT/USD, we can see that three higher highs on the price action have developed over the last week. A clear break-down has taken place within the last few hours to complete the bearish divergence.  It’s likely price levels will continue to drop further and test $9,000 support over the coming days. There’s clear rising support around $9,000 visible on higher time-frames, this will be a crucial level that determines whether price levels will drop much further. Clear selling pressure evident by the red volume spikes within the last few hours, however, volume still remains reasonably low in comparison to volume spikes seen throughout the beginning of July and late June. It would likely take a larger red volume spike like this to cause the rising support around $9,000 to break, as there are a lot of resting orders around this price level. This was also mentioned in a previous analysis. On the 4 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see the rising support around $9,000 as mentioned above. If Bitcoin price action breaks through this support with a clear influx of selling volume, it’s likely BTC will drop back to POC (Point of Control) at $7,790. The POC essentially acts as a magnet. In order for any uptrend or downtrend to be sustainable, price levels will often ”correct” or ”pull-back” to the POC in order for an exchange of hands amongst traders. In other words, for accumulation to take place and re-fuel the overall trend. Price action throughout the majority of May, June, and July traded above the 200 EMA, whilst the trend was very clearly bullish. As of recently, Bitcoin price action has dropped below the 200 EMA which is an indication that a large drop may be coming, in order to refuel the current trend as mentioned above. Once the rising support at $9,000 is broken, a move back to POC is the most likely outcome. Maxx Momentum flashed a small orange dot which is a sell/buy signal within the last few hours. Given the various bearish indications, it’s safe to assume this is a sell signal. Typically, Maxx Momentum will only flash orange ahead of a potential big move which aligns nicely with my thesis above on how BTC will play out over the coming days and weeks. Do you think BTC will re-test POC (Point of Control) at $7,790 before a continuation of the bullish trend occurs? Please leave your thoughts in the comments below!

BTC has made a few gains to keep it back about five figures, but only just.

Boris Johnson has been handed the unenviable task of guiding the UK through Brexit, coincidentally the economic unrest has caused a spike in the interest for bitcoin according to Google. Google searches have risen to their highest levels in England for a year according to reports. The term ‘bitcoin’ has generated more interest on Google Trends recently as Britain barrels towards a long awaited exit from the European Union. Fresh in the hot seat, Boris Johnson has maintained that he will not play ball with Brussels and a ‘no deal Brexit’ would be the case failing all other options. Politicians in opposing camps and ‘remainers’ have said this would be disastrous for the UK economy, but in reality the years of drawn out infighting and division appears to have done the damage so far. This scenario has clearly caused concern on an economic level as the GBP has fallen dramatically over the past year. Since the end of February Sterling has lost 7% against the US dollar, falling to a twelve month low of $1.238 this week. At the moment any hope of brighter days ahead for Britain is on the back burner as the likelihood of exiting the EU in October with no trade deals looms. The European Commission is remaining steadfast with President Jean-Claude Juncker, telling Boris Johnson that it will not give in to his demand to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. Fear mongering is at an all-time high but the country will not simply grind to a halt. People will still eat, planes will still fly, and business will carry on regardless. Although bitcoin searches on Google are up globally at the moment, it seems to be garnering more than its usual share of attention in Britain. When concern over economic issues and negative price action in fiat starts to occur, people begin seeking out alternatives as a hedge. Bitcoin, being a global currency, is a good place to start and Britain is not the only country with these trends. Countries sanctioned by the US are also keen on bitcoin as it can be used to circumvent them. Venezuela is one example as the state is now using BTC to pay aeronautical taxes. Russia, China, and Iran have also expressed more interest in cryptocurrencies as bitcoin slowly becomes the digital safety net for the planet. Will Brexit be a boon for bitcoin in Britain?

The IRS letters include instructions to pay taxes, interest, and penalties. The IRS started sending educational letters to taxpayers in mid-July 2019. The agency estimates that by the end of August 2019, more than 10,000 taxpayers will receive these letters. On July 26, 2019, IRS through Statement R-2019-132 informs about the letter campaign. In it, IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said, “Taxpayers should take these letters very seriously by reviewing their tax filings and when appropriate, amend past returns and pay back taxes, interest, and penalties.” Rettig also warned bitcoin and cryptocurrency users that the IRS is enhancing its campaign to address non-tax compliance, particularly those involving crypto transactions. He remarked, “The IRS is expanding our efforts involving virtual currency, including increased use of data analytics. We are focused on enforcing the law and helping taxpayers fully understand and meet their obligations.” Moreover, the tax collection agency indicated that the names of these taxpayers holding cryptocurrencies were obtained through several ongoing agency compliance efforts. In this connection, as Bitcoinist reported earlier, since 2017, the IRS has been requesting Coinbase, the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the U. S., to release information about over 14,000 customers who are U.S. citizen taxpayers. The IRS has said that it considers cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin property for federal tax purposes, meaning any profits or losses from their sale should generally be reported as capital gains or losses. Presently, the tax collection agency refers to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as “virtual currencies.” And it classifies them as an asset or property for U.S. federal tax purposes. Thus, purchasing Bitcoin is not a taxable event. However, paying with the cryptocurrency to buy something else is a sale of Bitcoin, similar to the sale of a property. Therefore, it is a taxable event. The IRS notice IR-2018-71, issued on March 23, 2018, specifies, “Virtual currency transactions are taxable by law, just like transactions in any other property.” Indeed, the IRS announcement underlines that the ongoing virtual currency campaign is considered a focus area for IRS Criminal Investigation. The IRS statement warns, “Taxpayers who do not properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions are, when appropriate, liable for tax, penalties, and interest. In some cases, taxpayers could be subject to criminal prosecution.” Do you think the ongoing IRS campaign on crypto taxes will impact Bitcoin’s value? Let us know in the comments below!

Bill Miller Thinks So,"['Bitcoin: The Safe Haven Asset', 'Bullish Prospects']","  davitbabayan | Jul 26, 2019 | 12:31 In December 2017, veteran investor Bill Miller took a risky decision to allocate half of his hedge fund to bitcoin. One and a half year later, the risk is paying off well. Miller Value Partners registered 46 percent profits in the first half of 2019, reported Bloomberg. The top performers in the hedge fund were Amazon, Inc. – an always reliable stock to have in one’s portfolio – and ADT Inc., a security system company whose stock was looking very bearish until March. Miller located gains after purchasing shares when the stock market was trending lower – a textbook strategy that helped his hedge fund bring the best profits in an otherwise gloomy market. Bitcoin, as mentioned above, also contributed widely to Miller’s success. The non-sovereign, decentralized asset, which legendary investor Warren Buffett rubbished as “a rat poison squared” turned nectar for the investor’s portfolio. It surged by more than 170 percent in the first half of this year to establish an 18-month high at circa $13,000. Bitcoin Surged by More Than 170% in 2019 | Image Credits: CoinMarketCap.com The second-best performing asset in Miller’s profile came to be Avon Products Inc., a beauty care company which got acquired by its competition Natura Cosmeticos SA.

The decade-old asset, which has been called names by recognized investors and economists (read Nouriel Roubini), has been continually proving its mettle in 2019. Investors were trying to protect their portfolio from a string of macroeconomic outlooks – including the ongoing US-China trade war, Fed rate cut, Brexit, and quantitative easing in Europe –  which are beginning to position bitcoin as a haven asset alongside gold. Andy Brenner of National Alliance noted a sharp divergence in bitcoin prices from that of Chinese Yuan, a national currency which lately hit its six-year low. “If you were in China and you wanted to diversify, it would seem logical that Bitcoin would be a short term alternative,” the head of international income said in a note to clients in May. “While we do not see the direct flows of who is buying bitcoin, we can see that the bid for bitcoin in this latest run has coincided with a big downtick in the value of the Chinese Yuan versus the dollar.” Bitcoin is also looking more attractive due to its improving scarcity against other commodities. Against an increase in demand promised by financial giants like TD Ameritrade, Fidelity Investments, and Bakkt, the supply of bitcoin is set to get reduced by half next year. The supply-demand scenario further positions the cryptocurrency as one of the most bullish assets out there. Nothing is surprising about why a veteran investor like Bill Miller would allocate half its hedge fund portfolio to bitcoin. As his risks pay off, the rest may follow suit.

On Thursday, July 25, a panel of Russian officials and experts discussed the regulation of cryptocurrency. The event was hosted by the press conference center of the “Parliamentary Newspaper,” an editorial managed by Russia’s Federal Assembly (the parliament). The experts concluded that the integration of cryptocurrency into Russia’s financial system is a question of a distant future. First of all, the issuance of money other than ruble is considered illegal by the Constitution. Secondly, financial regulators are confused about the origin of Bitcoin and its brethren. They are also worried that many criminals can benefit from cryptocurrencies. The round table was moderated by Senator Lyudmila Bokova, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Federation Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Building. She stated: I consider it expedient not to force the [regulatory] process, but to analyze the experience of bigger economies. Let’s see how regulation is implemented there and what benefits or damage a country might receive from the introduction of such regulation. The guests were Dmitry Zakharov, member of the Commission for the Legal Support of the Digital Economy of the Association of Lawyers of Russia, Mikhail Bykovsky, member of the thematic working group “Fintech” under the Center for Competence on the Digital Economy, and Arseny Poyarkov, Vice-President of the National Association of the Digital Economy. You can watch the full event below by turning on the subtitles with English translation:  Nevertheless, Russia should continue to work on legal mechanisms for regulating cryptocurrencies. Otherwise, the economy might lose the chance to evolve in line with the progressive digital practices observed in developed countries. The first step to create a legal framework for cryptocurrencies was made earlier this year, when lawmakers passed the “digital assets” law. However, the bill doesn’t allow the use of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in parallel with the national fiat currency. Crypto mining is also illegal for now. The invited experts insist on speeding up the crypto-friendly regulation. Dmitry Zakharov said that Russia really needed regulation and there was no time to wait. He added, We cannot overcome cryptocurrencies. While they (cryptocurrencies) were and are here to stay, the state still does not receive all the benefits that the new digital economy can provide Zakharov stated that the lack of proper regulation of digital currencies could lead to the outflow of experts and the loss of potential investors. Another reason to push for the crypto regulation is that Russia can benefit from mining operations thanks to its cheap electricity costs.

This, they claim, will help them to circumvent US and international sanctions.  Soyuzmash Vice President, Vladimir Gutenev, told the advisory council on military-technical co-operation, that current conditions were tough. The environment is not a competitive one, due to strong sanctions pressure. Payments for weapons which have already been delivered could be delayed for months, and transactions are increasingly difficult. However, Soyuzmash, backed by the State Duma defence commission, believes that allowing Bitcoin payments could alleviate some of the issues. anonymous transactions are one of the possible ways to solving existing problems The problem with this, of course, is that Russia’s Central Bank has been very vocal in not wanting to legalise Bitcoin. One of the key issues many authorities have with Bitcoin is its alleged use for purchasing illegal items on the dark web. So the illegality of Bitcoin in Russia preventing state-backed companies making morally questionable arms deals seems rather ironic. Apparently, Gutenev has discussed the matter personally with Central Bank Chief, Elvira Nabiullina. Failing Bitcoin, Gutenev also proposed using a stablecoin if the Central Bank was more amenable to this. Nabiullina is currently considering the suggestions. Russia is the second largest exporter of weapons worldwide, commanding 21% of the market, following the USA with 36%. A recent report suggested that countries such as Russia, China, Iran, and Venezuela may already have long-term cryptocurrency strategies, to avoid US sanctions and Dollar hegemony. Meanwhile, it seems that the Russian Duma is still divided over a coherent policy for cryptocurrency regulation. This, despite an intervention and 1st July deadline set by President Putin. Previous suggestions of a crypto-ruble launch have been put on indefinite hold, and legislators now seem willing to simply watch how cryptocurrency plays out in other countries before putting any plans into action. However, there was a call to rush through mining regulations, as energy providers were sitting on a surplus of supply. This could be provided to miners so that Russia did not fall behind other nations. Do you think Russia will lift the Bitcoin ban to help it’s nation’s weapon manufacturers?

Despite the Bullish sentiment, most indicators have created three lower lows displaying potential bearish divergence around $9,800.   On the 8 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see how price action has developed throughout the latest bull run over the last few months. Price levels are heading towards critical uptrend support at $8,800 as mentioned in my previous analysis. If price levels break this key support level the consensus for BTC short-term will no longer be bullish. It’s likely that if $8,800 breaks price levels could drop as low at $6,600 before recovering again. Despite this bearish outlook it’s important to remember the overall trend is still very much bullish at the moment. No real bearish momentum has built up during this pull-back from the highs of $13,200, it’s been more of a steady decline leading me to believe critical support at $8,800 will hold strong and the current pull-back is just a much-needed breather for the BTC bulls. Volume is clearly descending at this point visible on all time-frames which could propel price levels in either direction. If the lower volume continues as price levels approach $8,800 it’s likely that this level will not hold, adversely if a large volume spike occurs again similar to what we’ve seen throughout the tail end of June then it’s likely that will have a direct impact on price levels, and ending the short-term pull-back. Price action has clearly created higher highs and lower lows on the RSI indicator showing bearish divergence could be playing out at this level. On the 1 hour chart for XBT/USD, we can see the higher highs mentioned above that has developed over the last week stemming from $9,200 to $9,700. This leads me to believe $8,800 will be tested again over the coming days. I will be paying close attention to how price action reacts to testing this key support level to gauge where BTC will be heading. In order for price levels to bounce off of key support, there must be very clear resistance from bulls as price levels drop which will be evident from volatile price action and large volume spikes. There seems to be a large number of orders resting between $9,700 and $8,800, so it’s likely there won’t be a large sell-off candle but more of a gradual decline through this price stage over the course of the coming week. Do you think key support around $8,800 will hold for BTC over the coming days? Please leave your thoughts in the comments below!

Speaking in his latest interview with mainstream media this week, infamous Bitcoin bull Novogratz said institutions should drive markets higher in H2 2019.  “We had a big move from $4000 to around $13,500 and I think we’re going to consolidate… $8500 should probably be the low that holds,” he summarized to Bloomberg Canada about current price action. …And then I think these institutions kind of get excited again, maybe towards the end of the year or hopefully sooner, we push out of that range and we go back to the old highs of $20,000. The comments further reinforce cryptocurrency figures’ belief in Bitcoin’s short-term price potential, despite its bull run, which began in April and abruptly reversed in recent weeks.  As Bitcoinist reported, political suspicions over Facebook’s Libra digital currency offering spilled over into cryptocurrency in general, with US lawmakers using discussions on Libra to vent scorn over Bitcoin’s perceived dangers. At the same time, pressure from elsewhere includes renewed plans by India to ban cryptocurrency use altogether. Ostensibly impossible to do with decentralized blockchains such as Bitcoin’s, India’s central bank has nonetheless recommended authorities push ahead with the legislation. BTC/USD thus remains subdued, on Friday trading at under $10,000 while avoiding moves lower than its recent floor around $9100.  If Novogratz’s forecast seems somewhat optimistic, he is far from alone in the current climate. This week, digital asset manager and hedge fund Pantera Capital came out with a bold prediction which saw Bitcoin rising as high as $356,000 by 2022.  Based on trend analysis, CEO Dan Morehead said that such price action was in fact reasonable based on previous behavior. By the end of 2019, BTC/USD should thus be trading at $42,000. “It’s right on the trend line, and I think it’s a good shot that by the end of the year, we hit that, and then if you just extrapolate that line out for another year, it’s $122,000 per Bitcoin and in one more year $356,000,” he told the Unchained Podcast. Novogratz’s own tone has improved in recent months as Bitcoin recovered. Previously, he eyed $8000 as a reasonable target, something which for him now forms a support level, rather than a resistance level. What do you think about Mike Novogratz’s Bitcoin price prediction?

To overcome these issues, Banco Masventas, a provincial bank, now offers Bitcoin-based money transfers. Also, over-the-counter bitcoin trading is swiftly picking up pace despite massive price volatility.  Bank policies in Argentina have varied over time as to whether a non-account holder can exchange money at a private bank branch. Indeed, some banks will not exchange foreign currencies unless you have a bank account with them. Moreover, banks charge outrageous fees for foreign ATM withdrawals or transactions from foreign banks. For small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), international money transfers can be expensive and time-consuming. And, if the local bank does not have a presence abroad, it must use intermediaries. As a result, the costs of the transfer increase considerably. Now, Banco Masventas has come with the solution. It offers Bitcoin-based international money transfers. Banco Masventas’ headquarters is in Salta province, Argentina. According to ZonaBancos, a provider of news and analysis focusing on Argentina’s banking industry, Banco Masventas is partnering with the Bitcoin exchange Bitex. This partnership aims to perform international money transfers using Bitcoin and so to bypass the Swift network. The cost of using Swift varies from USD 120 to USD 150 per transaction. Bitex Co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Manuel Beaudroit told ZonaBancos, “We think of Bitcoin as a protocol of value transmission through which the ownership of an asset is transferred between two people. We, through technology, eliminate the price risk.” Beaudroit also referred to future projects in partnership with Bitex. In effect, they are already in conversations to jointly create a network involving about 100 banks in Latin America. During an interview with business intelligence platform BnAmerica, Beaudroit explained how Bitex operates, “Transfers are from local currency to local currency. The payment settlement takes approximately one hour and avoids the use of the traditional transaction mechanism, which involves a lot of costs and time due to the number of intermediaries in the chain.” Furthermore, referring to the role of Bitcoin, Beaudroit said, “Bitcoin blockchain is used, but neither the payer nor the payee is exposed to the currency itself, or to its fluctuations or knowing how it works. Only the underlying technology is used.” The cost of a Banco Masventas Bitcoin-based cross-border money transfer transaction varies from 1 percent to 2 percent, depending on the country involved. Heightened market volatility has failed to dampen crypto enthusiasm throughout Argentina, as over-the-counter (OTC) bitcoin trading volumes continue to soar. Data from monitoring resource Coin Dance, which tracks trading across three decentralized P2P platforms, confirmed the same. Neighboring countries also saw upticks in Bitcoin trading themselves, despite the impact of US President Donald Trump saying he did not believe in or appreciate Bitcoin’s value.

It is slowly but steadily infiltrating into the pop culture, with many sportsmen, actors, singers, media persons, and politicians discussing it. Many celebrities are sharing favourable opinions about the oldest cryptocurrency out there. One of the reasons is that they have benefited from the coin’s bullish rallies on different occasions. Last year, Rapper Soulja Boy boasted about his BTC gains in a track titled just like that – “Bitcoin.” Actor Hugh Laurie, who gained popularity for his main role in House series, became a BTC investor when a friend advised him to weigh the coin’s advantages. The British actor invested $5,000 in 2015. Last year, US actress and singer Gwyneth Paltrow endorsed cryptocurrencies after her publication “Goop” published a post describing the benefits of Bitcoin and crypto. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is increasingly popular among sportsmen too. Legendary boxer Mike Tyson said that he was proud to be part of the Bitcoin revolution. In 2015, he launched a network of BTC ATMs in Las Vegas. Even politicians admit the indestructible nature of Bitcoin. Earlier this month, US Congressman Patrick McHenry said that there is no way someone or something can kill the coin’s network. He told CNBC’s Squawk Box: I think there’s no capacity to kill Bitcoin. Even the Chinese with their Firewall and their extreme intervention on their society cannot kill Bitcoin. So, distributed ledger, full and open, in the essence of Bitcoin, as a first mover in the space, the developer of this technology. While Bitcoin is penetrating our pop culture, many politicians and celebrities are still skeptical about it. US President Donald Trump is perhaps the most evident example in this context. Earlier this month, he tweeted that he wasn’t a fan of Bitcoin. I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity…. — Donald J.

It enables customers to convert their Bitcoin to Kuna, the national fiat currency. On Thursday, Croatian Post (Hrvatska Pošta) announced that it is testing a crypto exchange service for cryptocurrency users. The state-owned corporation introduced the new service on July 15 of this year.  Croatian Post’s move suggests that the government of the Republic of Croatia is open to embrace the crypto revolution. The Southeastern European country has seen an increasing number of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency users over the past few years. It seems that Croatian Post wants to give a hand to the crypto community with its network of 1,016 postal offices. Bitcoin owners who want to exchange their crypto funds for cash can do this through several post offices in Zadar. Currently, the Croatian Post helps clients to convert crypto to Kuna only. Besides Bitcoin, the service supports Ethereum, Stellar, Ripple, and EOS. The exchange process is not lengthy, as one could expect from most postal services in Croatia. Users have to fill an application and scan a QR code. Then, they can raise their cash in the post office. Currently, the crypto-to-fiat conversion service is available in three post offices (Škožići Benje 1, Josip Juraj Strossmayera 8 and Maslenica Street 1) in Zadar, a city located on the Dalmatian coast. The project is implemented in collaboration with Croatian startup Electrocoin. The latter has been running the local crypto exchange service bitcoin-mjenjacnica.hr for about five years. While some governments try to limit the use of cryptocurrency on their territory, Croatia seems not to be worried about the expansion of the crypto industry. The country has also proven to encourage blockchain projects. At the beginning of this year, the capital city of Zagreb announced the launch of a city-wide blockchain strategy. Three companies were competing for a contract with Zagreb authorities, including professional services giant Deloitte, Croatian open-source platform operator Omega Software, and Croatian software firm IT Sistemi – Nove Tehnologije (IT Systems – New Technologies).

The derivatives marketplace said in a tweet Wednesday that it traded over 2 million contracts – which equals more than 10 million bitcoins – from December 2017 until July 21. It believably attracted clients as interest in bitcoin climbed higher after its 200 percent climb this year. That also coincided with the decision of Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) – a competition –to stop offering bitcoin futures contracts. Volume update: As of July 23, CME Bitcoin futures have traded over 2M total contracts (10M equivalent bitcoin) since the December 2017 launch. Explore BTC: https://t.co/Z1LGfdrbFL pic.twitter.com/NkmQnMnliM — CMEGroup (@CMEGroup) July 23, 2019  CME started posting a higher number of contracts since May, the month that saw bitcoin spot rate closing above a psychological resistance level of $6,000. As on May 13, the exchange had posted 1.3 billion worth of BTC futures contracts. A week later, the number of contracts touched its all-time high of circa 5,190. CME Bitcoin Futures June Stats | Image Credits: CME The trend improved further in June. CME reported that its bitcoin futures reached “a record $1.7 billion in notional value traded on June 26, surpassing the previous record by more than 30 percent,” adding: “The surge in volume also set a new open interest record of 6,069 contracts as institutional interest continues to build.” Bitcoin futures at CME are ideal for investors who do not want to hold bitcoins but want to speculate on its value via regulated platforms. That further means that all the bitcoin futures contracts get settled in physical cash upon expiration, not in the cryptocurrency itself. Often criticized by the cryptocurrency community for not adding anything beneficial to the real bitcoin market, futures are still considered a metric to gauge mainstream investors’ interest in the cryptocurrency. Bakkt, a bitcoin futures platform backed by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), on Monday began the testing of its daily and monthly contracts. That marks the beginning of the first bitcoin-settled future in the real-world which, as experts believe, would boost the demand of the cryptocurrency among institutional players. While Bakkt goes ahead with its plans, LedgerX and ErisX are also going to launch their bitcoin-settled futures contracts. Neither firm has announced the release date of their products. The trio nevertheless is likely to hit a minor snag when it comes to scoring a regulatory approval. Bakkt, for instance, is launching a self-certified bitcoin futures contract. It is then up to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to approve or reject the product based on its merits. If approved, Bakkt would need to seek the controversial BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). On the brighter side, NYDFS has introduced a special division for the cryptocurrency industry to streamline their applications smoothly. Do you think tradeable futures offerings are good for Bitcoin?

A Binance Research study shows that DeFi has grown spectacularly in less than a year.  On June 6, 2019, Binance Research released a study focusing on platforms and lending and borrowing protocols that intend to radically change the financial industry, such as DeFi. Researchers define DeFi, as follows: An ecosystem comprised of applications built on decentralized networks, permissionless blockchains, and peer-to-peer protocols for the facilitation of lending/borrowing or trading with financial instruments. Bitcoin and Ethereum networks were the first networks to run DeFi applications. Presently, most of the DeFi protocols run on Ethereum. According to the study as of June 5, 2019, the value of Ethereum-based DeFi applications reached over $500 million. And DeFi applications running on the Bitcoin network amount to approximately $8 million. Most surprisingly however, EOS has surged as the largest network running a DeFi application, in terms of collateral value. EOS boasts more than $600 million locked by its blockchain, as of June 5, 2019. The chart below refers.  The study highlights that DeFi platforms offer different incentives for market participants. Specifically, • For borrowers: the ability to short an asset or borrow utility (e.g., governance rights). • For lenders: the ability to insert capital to use and earn interest. • For both: arbitrage opportunities across platforms. The wide range of assets supported on Ethereum-based platforms comprises two categories: native blockchain assets and non-native block assets. Native blockchains assets are defined as assets whose value is not backed by any non-native blockchain asset such as a commodity, equity, or fiat currency. MakerDao (MKR) and its DAI stablecoin is an example of a native blockchain asset. DAI’s value is pegged to the U.S. dollar through smart contracts. The study stresses that DAI is one of the most significant components of the DeFi ecosystem built on Ethereum.  Other examples of native assets include ERC-20 tokens, such as Augur (REP), Basic Attention Token (BAT), and 0x (ZRP). These crypto-assets can be used as collateral for a loan, lendable assets, borrowable assets, and governance assets (e.g., Maker/MKR). Conversely, non-native blockchain assets are stablecoins collateralized by fiat money on bank accounts. The study finds that Ethereum is currently the standard default platform for many decentralized applications, such as the lending and borrowing protocols, Compound and Dharma. Both lending platforms have seen constant growth since their release.  In less than a year, DeFi has grown to become one of the most active sectors of blockchain in 2019, according to Concensys. Moreover, the Binance Research study forecasts, DeFi, as illustrated by these lending and borrowing platforms, appears as one of the best use-cases of blockchain technology which could reach up to billions of users across the globe and allow access to basic financial services at efficient rates.

But a month on from Facebook’s official announcement of its ‘cryptocurrency’, what do the general public think? The latest survey from Civic Science gives us some insight.  During a survey of 1,799 US adults taken just after the announcement, Civic Science found that very few people cared. Just 5% of those polled were somewhat or very interested, with a whopping 86% ‘not at all interested’. Well they might not have been interested then, but they can’t fail to have an opinion now. Libra has dominated both financial and mainstream news channels. From the Winklevoss twins burying the hatchet, to being called a ‘sh*tcoin’ in congress, Libra has been hard to avoid. So how has this media frenzy affected the consumer perspective? A July survey of over 2100 adults suggests that Facebook’s biggest hurdle is the trust factor. Of those surveyed, 79% had heard of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, although only 6% had invested in them. Top reason for buying into crypto was as a short or long term investment, so not something you might use Libra for. When asked how much they trusted Facebook with personal data in general, over three quarters answered ‘not at all’. Only 2% trusted Facebook ‘a lot’, with 21% having ‘a little’ trust in the company. The responders were then asked how much they trusted Libra compared to Bitcoin or similar cryptocurrencies. 40% of responders trusted Bitcoin more, with the vast majority saying they trusted Bitcoin ‘much more’. Only 2% of people responded that they trusted Libra somewhat or much more. The remaining 58% either trusted both the same or weren’t sure. So even though only 6% of those surveyed had invested in cryptocurrencies, a full 40% trusted Libra less than Bitcoin. It seems that the media and regulatory spotlight thrown on Libra has succeeded in turning apathy to mistrust. Whether Facebook can weather this storm remains to be seen. But a lot depends on it gaining the public’s trust. What do you think of these survey findings? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!

The report added that the state has been using an app developed by a subsidiary of a Florida based firm which collects taxes. The application called ‘Jetman Pay’ collects aeronautical taxes, before converting them into BTC through crypto wallets, and then sending them to other countries such as Russia, China and Bulgaria. The bitcoin is then sent back to Venezuela in USD to close the circle. The initiative is regulated by the ‘National Superintendence of Cryptoactives’ (SUNACRIP), an agency setup by Maduro to launch the state backed Petro cryptocurrency. The Petro has not been used in this instance because bitcoin is more globally recognized and easier to convert in other countries. The report added that this method of airport tax collection is only in operation in Caracas but there are plans to expand it to other airports and the port of La Guaira. There are also plans to use the app for refueling in addition to tax settlements. The Jetman Pay app has been designed to collect tourist and airport taxes from commercial airlines, cargo and private planes. It is now in operation for all flights in and out of Maiquetía International Airport (IAIM). The Trump administration has slapped sanctions on state oil company PDVSA which means those accounts have been blocked in an effort to cut the cash flow to President Maduro. The Petro was created in order to circumvent this financial blockade but it appears that the government now favors bitcoin instead. For the people of Venezuela, bitcoin has been the savior against galloping hyperinflation which has crippled the country. Data from peer to peer trading activity tracker, Coin Dance, reveals that the seven days to July 20 were Venezuela’s biggest bitcoin volumes on record. Users on LocalBitcoins alone generated volumes of over 57 billion Bolivars, this eclipsed the previous all-time high of 49 billion the previous week.

There is amazing energy in Washington, and people are ready to talk about crypto and find solutions for all Americans. Today was a good day for cryptocurrency! pic.twitter.com/wYz13oI0gb — ERIK FINMAN (@erikfinman) July 24, 2019  Let’s see if we can’t debunk Erik Finman’s alleged trip to Washington. A tour of the capitol building is free first off, so even if Finman did go to Washington, it’s not like he needed to be a special guest to enter the building. Secondly, there is no sign of congressional representatives in the camera shot, which is very convenient. And finally, there is no actual proof that this picture was even taken in Washington – all we can see is just a handful of props and a blank wall. But just in case there might be someone who doubts the legitimacy of a single picture without any context, audience, microphone, or placard… Erik Finman needs a Trump card (pun very much intended). Something to put his claimed ‘briefing’ beyond question. What about a video interview, fresh from the briefing room, with a sympathetic media channel? In steps Cheddar, which is either woefully naive, wilfully ignorant, or paid off. Either way, it publishes a four and a half minute video of Finman standing outside a room. The room has a plaque, a security guard, and what looks like a tour group of schoolchildren coming out of it. In the video, Erik Finman claims he has addressed congressmen, staffers, legislators, and policy-makers on Bitcoin. Some of them, supposedly, for the very first time. Although why they missed to mention the previous congressional hearings is anybody’s guess? The session was reportedly co-hosted by republican congressman, Paul Gosar. During the interview, Finman is questioned on several of the aspects and events currently gripping the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency scene. In response, he delivers the kind of platitudes that illustrate just what a poor choice of speaker he would be… if this was not just all in his head. Erik Finman has no special insight into Bitcoin and the crypto-industry. He got lucky by discovering it and buying in early. He is now spending some of his early gains in an attempt to stay relevant. He is not. The opinions expressed in this piece are exclusively those of the author and are not the views of the publication, nor any of its colleagues.

John will be assuming control of this account again after travel.” Another tweet, seemingly from McAfee himself, then read: “Leaving detention (don’t judge my looks – four days of confinement). I was well treated. My superiors were friendly and helpful. In spite of the helpful circumstances, we’ve decided to move on.” Leaving detention (don't judge my looks – four days of confinement).

Armed forces then arrested them upon their arrival in the Dominican Republic, with McAfee spending four days in confinement.  The events mark the latest drama in a long debacle involving McAfee, which has included controversy over an “unhackable” Bitcoin wallet he endorsed last year and more recently a spat with proponents of altcoin Bitcoin SV. As Bitcoinist reported, McAfee was forced to withdraw claims the BitFi wallet was unbreachable after a developer demonstrated proof he had circumvented its security.  Bitcoin SV supporter Calvin Ayre meanwhile publicly called him a “moron” in April after his allegations that self-proclaimed ‘creator’ of Bitcoin Craig Wright was a “fraud.” McAfee is running on a largely anti-establishment platform in 2020, his official website stating “freedom for the people” forms his main priority.  “So do not ask me about immigration, foreign relations, education, etc. I have no idea,” it states. “Those claiming that they do are lying to themselves, or if not, they are purposely lying to you. We must first be free. Freedom for The People is my only goal.” Bitcoin donations naturally form a feature of the campaign, while other hopefuls, such as Andrew Yang, have also embraced cryptocurrency as an election play.  What do you think about John McAfee’s release?

Typically, a Doji can go in any direction and is heavily dependant on the overall trend of the coin. In this case, BTC is still very much bullish so we are assuming an upside continuation will ensue over this time frame. Volume right now are still sustaining levels way above that seen throughout the bull run in 2017 and 2018. POC (Point of Control) has yet to move up from $6,430 meaning the highest amount of volume or trades exchanged throughout this bullish phase on BTC still remains quite low. This will be a very bullish sign as it shows us high volume is exchanging hands at this level and represents a new critical support level. More information on this key support level can be found in my previous analysis.  On the 1 hour XBT/USD chart, we can see the second descending channel break clearly with price action now attempting to create a small bull flag just below the 200EMA. The volume appears to steady with no real jumps during this breakout. This suggests that Bitcoin bears are really struggling to build up momentum inside this time frame. Maxx Momentum has crossed to the upside painting green in conjunction with this breakout after displaying red throughout the descending channel. POC still remains back at the top of the channel at $10,500 as mentioned in my previous analysis, which will likely as act as a magnet for price action thus making a sensible profit target on this move upwards. The previous range local high was $9,400 before BTC went on to reach just shy of $14,000 meaning the previous breakout point has already been re-tested for BTC. When a breakout occurs many traders will wait for a pull-back and re-test of the breakout point before entering. BTC has already re-tested the previous breakout point and bounced quite significantly back up to $11,000. From this, we know that support around $9,400 is very strong and will require a lot of selling pressure to break. Do you think BTC will hit POC at $10,500 over the coming days as a result of this most recent breakout? Please leave your thoughts in the comments below!

Universal Free Internet', 'Will Bitcoin Moon from Affordable Internet?']","  Eustace Cryptus | Jul 25, 2019 | 02:08 As billionaire businessmen Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos plan to launch thousands of satellites into the Earth’s orbit, crypto investors ponder how this will benefit Bitcoin. Bloomberg recently reported that Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are planning to launch approximately 3,200 low-orbit satellites. A July 4 filing from Amazon indicates that the fleet will provide low-cost broadband to tens of millions of people living in areas lacking proper access to the internet.  Musk also has the same idea in mind and appears a few steps ahead of Bezos and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has already granted Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., permission to launch 11,943 satellites and the company launched 60 in May. Bezos said the project is expected to cost “multiple billions of dollars” and in April Amazon issued a statement explaining that:  This is a long-term project that envisions serving tens of millions of people who lack basic access to broadband internet.”  While it’s clear that the two billionaires are now in a literal space race, the outcome could be beneficial to a significant portion of the Earth’s population. Cryptocurrency supporters were also intrigued by the announcements and many are now speculating how affordable worldwide internet (courtesy of Elon Musk) could benefit Bitcoin.  Popular crypto-Twitter analyst Rhythmtrader suggested that “with a cheap smartphone, anyone in the world, no matter how remote, will be able to use Bitcoin.”   Rhythmtrader believes that universal internet access will allow Bitcoin to truly serve as “the currency of the people” but not everyone agrees with him. Fellow crypto-Twitter analyst Dave the Wave quickly retorted, “right and corporations are taking over the world with their digital surveillance.” Other followers pointed out that Bitcoin has ‘already gone outer space’ and referenced Blocksteam’s satellite and the ability to send Bitcoin via radio waves.  It seems sensible to conclude that cheap, universal internet will bode well for Bitcoin and adherents to the Bitcoin to $100k school of thought will point out that the digital asset’s limited supply will translate to exponential growth in the value of each coin.  Amazon’s FCC filing mentioned that currently, 21 million Americans lack access to fixed, residential broadband and at least 33 million don’t have access to fast internet. Furthermore, worldwide nearly 3.8 billion people do not have access to reliable broadband and many of these people happen to live in places where cryptocurrency exists as a feasible solution for the lack of developed banking and payments infrastructure.  Do you think Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos will catalyze Bitcoin adoption?

The data resided in the YouHodler database system. YouHodler provides cryptocurrency lending services. It also allows users to instantly convert crypto assets to U.S. dollars or euros. In addition to Bitcoin, the lending platform supports BCH, ETH, LTC, XLM, XRP, DASH, REP, as well as other crypto-assets. The YouHodler data breach exposed a massive amount of privacy data including users’ full names, email addresses, addresses, phone numbers, birthdays, credit card numbers, CVV numbers, full bank details, and crypto wallet addresses.  Investigators underlined how severe and extensive the breach’s implications are. For example, YouHodler tagged credit cards CVV (card verification value) numbers as “identity.” And these CVV numbers were entirely unencrypted. Moreover, investigators added, “Here, we found the card number in full, stored in plain text as well as the expiration date, but without the CVV number. However, the first example shows that we still found all of the details needed to take full control of the card – including CVV numbers.”  Similarly, users’ full names, addresses, and bank details such as account number and SWIFT code were exposed. In some cases, records containing crypto wallet addresses were also exposed. As a result, investigators concluded, “It was simple to link the account above to the Bitcoin wallet address. While the contents of crypto-wallets are publicly available, they are purposely anonymous. Linking a name and address to a wallet could have serious consequences.” VpnMentor is a security research firm that advocates for web privacy. It described how the security team discovered the breach as follows, “We found the leak in YouHodler’s database as part of our web-mapping project. Ran and Noam examine ports to find known IP blocks. Once they’ve discovered IP blocks, they look for holes in the system that would indicate an open database. Using their technical expertise, they can confirm the identity of a leak to trace the data back to its owner.” Cryptocurrency lending services, such as YouHodler, had been seeing widespread adoption and had been becoming a vital service for the crypto industry. After vpnMentor contacted YouHodler on July 22, 2019, YouHodler reportedly closed the breach the following day.

Fornebu-based Norwegian Air announced Tuesday that it would soon launch a bitcoin exchange service called Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX). The one-of-a-kind service would enable users to trade and pay from the same interface. Norwegian Air users, in particular, will be able to purchase airline tickets using bitcoin. They would also be able to earn reward points via trading, so to use them later for reaping travel discounts and other benefits. NBX’s customers are given the opportunity to earn cash points on trades on the stock exchange, as well as on payments made through the payment solution NBX stock for the airline,” Stig A. Kjos-Mathisen, the head of the exchange, told media. Norwegian Air operates across the world with a squadron of 195 aircraft in over 500 routes. The high frequency of traveling has earned the Norway firm the tag of Europe’s third-largest airline service. Nevertheless, its earnings in the fiscal year 2018 didn’t reflect the popularity. Simple Flying [SF] reports that Norwegian Air lost about $170 million last year. The depressive statistics followed an increase in machinery issues, fuel hedge losses, and loss of competitive edge to other airline companies. Norwegian’s Dreamliners experienced issues with their Rolls-Royce engines,” found SF. “Consequently, the airline had to wet-lease aircraft in order to avoid delays and cancellations on Dreamliner flights. The engine issues turned out to be rather costly for the airline. Norwegian Air ventured into the bitcoin business after promising investors a better fiscal performance in 2019. The decentralized cryptocurrency, which itself lost more than 80% of its market valuation last year, emerged as one of the best-performing assets in 2019. Bitcoin surged by more than 200% upon hitting bottom near the $3,100 level. Moreover, the cryptocurrency is surrounded by a more fabulous investor sentiment thanks to the entry of big financial firms like Fidelity Investments, TD Ameritrade, and Intercontinental Exchange. Norwegian Air, it seems, went to bitcoin intending to spread its risk profile. The announcement marked bitcoin’s growing profile among the traveling companies around the world. American travel company Expedia accepts bitcoin via Coinbase for hotel and flight bookings. Another popular agency CheapAir also enables bitcoin payment on its platform. Australian firm TravelbyBit also specializes in enabling local merchants to accept cryptocurrencies as payments. The company has secured $100,000 funding from the Queensland government. If you travel around the world you have to deal with multiple currencies, the exchange rate can be confusing, sometimes you struggle to find ATMs, and sometimes you get swindled by money changers. Traveling with one global currency like Bitcoin … makes sense,” said Caleb Yeoh, the CEO of TravelbyBit. What do you make of Norwegian Air’s venture into Bitcoin?

NYDFS Announces Crypto-Licensing Division,"['A New BitLicense Division', 'The Regulatory Landscape Needs To Evolve', 'How This Affects Bakkt']","  Emilio Janus | Jul 24, 2019 | 12:00 The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) yesterday announced the creation of a new division for licensing crypto-businesses. The ‘Research and Innovation’ Division will supervise and license virtual currencies, address financial inclusion through technology, protect consumer data rights, and encourage innovation in the financial services marketplace. Four years ago, NYDFS introduced the notorious BitLicense, for crypto companies wishing to partake in ‘virtual currency activities’. Since its introduction, only a relative handful of cryptocurrency businesses have gained one. Many believed the requirements for a BitLicense to be unnecessarily strict, causing some to cease trading in the state. Its terms were considered too onerous and damaging to innovation, and it became the yardstick by which other disruptive legislation was measured. With this new division, NYDFS has addressed the need for these applications to be dealt with by a dedicated team. In announcing the new division, Superintendent Linda Lacewell stressed the need for the crypto regulatory landscape to evolve and adapt as innovation continues to grow. This new division… position[s] DFS as the regulator of the future, allowing the Department to better protect consumers, develop best practices, and analyze market data to strengthen New York’s standing as the center of financial innovation. Hopefully, another benefit of having a dedicated division to oversee cryptocurrencies will be to expedite the BitLicense application process. As Bitcoinist reported yesterday, Bakkt began User Acceptance Testing of its Bitcoin Futures products on Monday. Though this was purportedly ‘on schedule’, Bakkt has seen many delays prior to this, awaiting regulatory approval. Despite gaining CFTC approval by default (lack of disapproval), it still has approval from one regulatory authority to attain. Bakkt needs to become a qualified custodian in order to fully launch its futures products, and this lies in the hands of the NYDFS. Bakkt will certainly hope that this new division helps to expedite the process, as it has already been in application for several months. Interestingly, NYDFS has previously issued a BitLicense to a company for custodial services, back in November last year. Perhaps Bakkt’s Bitcoin futures products could launch sooner than we think?","['Bakkt', 'bitcoin regulation', 'BitLicense NewYork', 'NYDFS']"

Speaking to CNBC on Wednesday (July 24, 2019), Secretary Mnuchin waved off suggestions that he would be a bitcoin “gazillionaire” in the next years. The U.S. Treasury Secretary retorting: I won’t be talking about bitcoin in 10 years, I can assure you that.

Over the past decade, bitcoin has gone against the stark predictions issued by the Wall Street establishment. It is 2019 and the bitcoin conversation is even more saturated than ever. Meanwhile, many of the major institutional adoption cases are yet to take off fully. If Mnuchin isn’t talking about BTC in 10 years, well that might be one fewer person spewing unsolicited FUD about the market. Also, while the Treasury Secretary busies himself with “other priorities,” over the next decade, the expected generational wealth shift could see trillions of dollars flow into bitcoin. Wednesday’s comments also cast a brighter light on the extent of Mnuchin’s bitcoin aversion if he is indeed being honest. Over the past few weeks, the U.S. Treasury secretary has had nothing complimentary to say about BTC or cryptos in general. Secretary Mnuchin has even gone as far as to liken bitcoin with Swiss-numbered accounts. One wonders how money launderers got by before Satoshi Nakamoto created BTC. The likes of Wells Fargo and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) have helped launder billions of dollars via fiat. It isn’t much of a stretch to imagine a person definitively saying on live TV as that fiat has never been used for illicit purposes declaring that he wouldn’t adopt a game-changer like BTC. Finally, it hardly matters if Mnuchin isn’t loaded up on bitcoin in the next 10 years. By that time, it may even be possible to “buy bitcoin.” What do you think about Mnuchin saying he won’t be loaded up on BTC in the next 10 years? Let us know in the comments below.

Tweeting on Tuesday (July 23, 2019), the bitcoin exchange founder described the report by the inter-ministerial committee (IMC) calling for a crypto ban in India as being flawed. 1/ The Crypto report is FLAWED right from the beginning. It wrongly states that every crypto is a ""currency"" & goes on to formulate suggestions on that flawed assumption Report wants to criminalise the youth,Innovators,investors Dear @nsitharaman @narendramodi #IndiaWantsCrypto — Nischal (WazirX) ⚡️ (@NischalShetty) July 23, 2019  For Shetty, members of the committee drew on flawed assumptions in coming up with their conclusions. For one, the IMC characterized cryptos as being “private currencies” — a classification meant to put the entire asset class in direct conflict with the Indian rupee. Lawmakers in the country have even called for a crypto ban as a way of preserving rupee monopoly. Other jurisdictions like the U.S. have seen it fit to classify cryptos as commodities making them an investment asset. The WazirX chief believes the decision isn’t a mistake. Rather, it is an attempt to criminalize digital innovation. Shetty advised the government to form a standing committee on cryptos — a recommendation also present in the IMC report. The WazirX founder also warned that going forward with the crypto ban would have devastating consequences for the country. Shetty’s accusation of a crypto ban decision being based on flawed logic isn’t a new development in India. Back in 2018, several crypto stakeholders accused the central bank of not conducting thorough research before banning banks from offering services to crypto exchanges. Now, there are reports that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) — the country’s central bank, was the major driving force behind the IMC’s recommendation for a crypto ban. The WazirX CEO has previously berated the RBI for being obtuse about cryptos. On the subject of the consequences of a possible total crypto ban in India, Twitter user ‘DesiCryptoHodlr’ is of the opinion that the entire industry would feel the effects of such an action.

The fear of prosecution and prison sentences could also see a massive brain drain out of the country. However, whether the entire industry would feel the effect is debatable. China’s crypto trading and ICO ban did little to slow the progress of the emerging market. It stands to reason that India’s ban wouldn’t negatively impact the industry as much.

In a report issued July 10, Craig Cohen, a strategist for JPMorgan Chase, said changing habits among non-US central banks are creating a real sense of unease about the dollar’s long-term status. Classically the world’s reserve currency, the greenback is seeing increasing competition from foreign powers and fallbacks such as gold.  “Central banks across the globe are also adding to gold reserves at their strongest pace on record. 2018 saw the strongest demand for gold from central banks since 1971 and a rolling four-quarter sum of gold purchases is the strongest on record,” Cohen wrote.  To us, this makes sense: gold is a stable source of value with thousands of years of trust among humans supporting it. While JPMorgan predictably did not mention cryptocurrency, the comments underscore the increasing schism between the financial world and US politicians, including President Donald Trump, who remain convinced they can preserve the dollar’s stature. As Bitcoinist reported, Trump himself reiterated that desire in recent comments on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, in which he said he “was not a fan” of them. “We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!” he wrote at the time.  JPMorgan meanwhile also noted the dollar’s declining overall share of central bank reserves, which has dipped from 64% in 2008 to 55% today.  Trump’s trade war will further heighten the stakes, Cohen added, suggesting investors should even diversify away from USD. “Given the persistent—and rising—deficits in the United States (in both fiscal and trade), we believe the U.S. dollar could become vulnerable to a loss of value relative to a more diversified basket of currencies, including gold,” he admitted. As Bitcoinist noted, multiple sources have forecast Bitcoin playing an increasingly vital role as a reserve currency in future years. Those forecasts have come in different styles, with suspicions already circulating that central banks are already adding it to their stockpiles. For its part, traditionally Bitcoin-skeptical JPMorgan has confirmed it will begin testing its in-house digital currency, JPM Coin, towards the end of the year.

This, he confirmed, includes the possibility of BTC/USD hitting $356,000 in 2021 if its historical compound annual growth rate persists. At the bottom of the 2018 bear market, when Bitcoin traded at $3100, Pantera considered what growth would be if the price returned to its historical trend line and then kept up that performance in future years. “That put Bitcoin at $42,000 at the end of 2019, which I know sounds crazy, but essentially we’re halfway back there,” Morehead said. “It’s right on the trend line, and I think it’s a good shot that by the end of the year, we hit that, and then if you just extrapolate that line out for another year, it’s $122,000 per Bitcoin and in one more year $356,000[.]” Bitcoin’s volatile last few weeks has concerned analysts who were already considering where the three-month-long bull market which began in April would end.  Currently trading under $9800, Bitcoin is now 30% below its recent highs of $13,800, challenging even other, less optimistic, prediction models which put it at $21,000 by the end of the year.  As Bitcoinist noted, $9800 support is all that stopped markets from falling further this week, as traders nurse 11% monthly losses. For Morehead, however, the psychology behind bigger numbers for the Bitcoin price has already proven its nature.  “…($42,000, $122,000 and $356,000) sound crazy, but (in) our first research piece that we wrote on Bitcoin, we predicted it would go to $5000, and when it was at 100 bucks, everyone thought that was totally nuts, but these numbers, in 2 or 3 years, people look back and go, oh yeah, that makes sense,” he continued. Similar logic could lend weight to some of the boldest Bitcoin price forecasts still on the market, including John McAfee’s infamous $1 million bet with himself.  Others, such as investor Tim Draper’s $250,000 price tag by 2023, also ensure Morehead is not alone in his bullish outlook.

Does this mean Bitcoin is a better store of value or does it still have potential as a medium of exchange? Today, crypto-analyst and Tales From the Crypt podcast co-host Matt Odell noted that the amount of untouched Bitcoin has grown significantly over the past five years. Odell referenced a Coin Metrics chart which shows Bitcoin’s ‘untouched supply’ recently reaching a new all-time high. Untouched coins are those which have not been transferred from a wallet, and the chart measures Bitcoin held for 180 days to 2 years.   The data suggest that BTC is steadily becoming more of a store of value than a medium of exchange, but the significance of this suggestion various depending on one’s reason for acquiring Bitcoin. Those in the ‘Bitcoin to $100k’ camp will use the data to support the belief that Bitcoin is entering a bull market that will take it well above its previous all-time high.  Others, like Willy Woo, might express concerns that the lack of Bitcoin circulation could lead to a decrease in volatility that could make the asset mirror the price action of commodities like gold. Earlier today, Adaptive Capital partner and crypto-analyst Willy Woo tweeted a chart of gold’s price action over the past century and asked:   Essentially, Woo projected his concern that if the majority of BTC becomes held by a few wealthy hands, then this group will become the “new bankers”. The fact that Bitcoin has a limited supply and large institutional investors steadily accumulated cryptocurrency throughout 2018 means there is a degree of credibility to Woo’s concern.   Tuur Demeester quickly countered Odell’s tweet by saying, “I’m not so sure… 5 years without updating your cold storage method is a long time in Bitcoin. IMO most of these coins are likely lost.” Closer investigation of Coin Metrics chart shows that there has been a noticeable uptick in the amount of ‘untouched coins’ on the 180-day and 1-year timeframe when compared against longer-time frames and this growth corresponds with Bitcoin’s price increase in USD.  CoinMetrics also pointed out that:  Although the size of the BTC supply has been consistently growing, the percent of the overall supply of BTC that has been untouched for at least five years also recently reached a five year high of 21.6% If one takes the data from Coin Metrics literally, then it seems sensible to assume that as Bitcoin’s price continues to increase so will the number of untouched coins. Although there is the possibility that long-term holders who bought BTC at its $20,000 peak onto $16,000 could be looking to exit their positions as the digital asset approaches previous all-time highs. It’s likely these holders will be influenced by the strength of Bitcoin’s future rallies and its technical setup as it reaches these previous highs.  Do you think the number of unmoved Bitcoin will rise as Bitcoin’s value increases?

Now, developer Sylvain Saurel identifies several compelling reasons for preferring Bitcoin over conventional currencies.  The combination of an obsolete banking system and a three-thousand-year-old fiat monetary system is becoming incompatible with the new borderless, decentralized, and fast-moving digital economic model. As a result, a growing number of industry experts agree that BTC is better than cash. For example, in December 2017, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates explicitly said, “Bitcoin is better than currency.” Saurel now puts forward several reasons why Bitcoin is better than cash. These reasons are summarized below. BTC helps users to satisfy their desire for hiding their wealth. According to Saurel, BTC could play the role of Swiss banks. Until January 2017, Swiss bank secrecy allowed rich people from all over the world to hide wealth. But now Swiss banks must share data in compliance with global standards on taxation. The leading cryptocurrency can also help millions of adults who do not have access to bank services around the world. Indeed, over two billion people remain without bank accounts, according to a World Bank report published in April 2015. In the U.S., an FDCIC national survey revealed that in 2017, 6.5% of American households were unbanked. An additional 18.7 percent of the households were underbanked. In this regard, Saurel points out, Bitcoin is, therefore, a blessing for unbanked people as it can provide them with access to equivalent services Central banks control fiat money. In contrast, Bitcoin is decentralized and under the control of no authority. Saurel remarks, Again, this is a major advantage because no authority will be able to arbitrarily prohibit you from carrying out a transaction in Bitcoin. Another plus is its ability to perform easy and anonymous online transactions. Although these transactions are registered on the blockchain, Saurel argues, only your wallet address is listed. If you do not tell anyone that these addresses belong to you, no one will know what you have done with your Bitcoins. Conversely, online cash payments are not private. Banks control online payments and know about all your purchases. Unlike with conventional cash, once a BTC payment is made, it is irreversible. Therefore, merchants can reduce their risks by avoiding customers who cancel their purchases. Moreover, BTC is an investment because traders can exploit Bitcoin’s volatility to make capital gains. Lastly, Saurel considers Bitcoin to represent a great revolution. Thus, he advises, “Without going as far as the Bitcoin Maximalists, you could choose to buy and use Bitcoins to be at the beginning of a revolution that will have huge impacts on the future of money.” What other reasons can you think of to explain why Bitcoin is better than cash?

The figures come despite BTC/USD breaking down in recent recents due to regulatory sentiment in the US and elsewhere – a further demonstration that price performance matters little when assessing Bitcoin acceptance.  Nonetheless, all three technical metrics regularly saw new highs in 2019 as Bitcoin rose in value, the trend has a knock-on effect for mining, which became much more profitable.  As such, the hashrate of the Bitcoin blockchain – the total computing power available to process batches of transactions – is now higher than ever at 79 million terahashes per second (TH/s). More power means increased transaction processing security, cementing Bitcoin’s position as the most secure cryptocurrency.  “Never before has wealth been stored with such security. This drives BTC price. Which drives hashrate. Bitcoin won,” the Twitter user known as Hodlonaut, who organized the Lightning Torch transaction relay, wrote in late June as hash rate passed 57 million TH/s. The difficulty, too – how much effort is required by miners to solve equations and validate a block – shows mining is now more competitive than ever before. Since the start of July, the figure has jumped by 14% – from 7.9 trillion to just over 9 trillion.  Blockchain data captures the return to form for the mining sector, with difficulty achieving its all-time highs just six months after dipping during the final phase of the 2018 bear market.  At the time, Bitcoinist noted, miners and mining businesses were sounding the alarm about profitability, leading to lower participation and hence lower difficulty, a phenomenon which nonetheless decreases overall network security.  Bitcoin network volumes were also markedly down as investors dug in to wait out the lower price levels. This month, meanwhile, huge amounts of value are changing hands on the blockchain.   For July 22, a spike in the data showed over 6 million BTC in transaction outputs occurred, including coins returned to the sender as change. That number far outstripped the previous record of 5 million BTC which occurred earlier this month.  What do you think about the Bitcoin network performance?

Bears are struggling to gain any momentum as price levels toy with key support around $9,850 as mentioned in my previous analysis.  On the 1 hour chart, we can see the newly formed descending channel as a result of the recent move from $11,000 down to around $9,900 just above key support at $9,850. POC (Point of Control) still sits back at $10,600 on the hourly, indicating no real bearish momentum has built up in this recent pull-back. MACD has also been fairly lifeless during this downturn with no wild jumps or drops when compared to MACD’s activity throughout mid-July. Typically, such a narrow descending channel is very bullish, similar to the falling wedge. This is now the 2nd descending channel that has formed on my chart above, which compared with the current bullish trend on BTC, paints a bullish picture for the days and weeks to come. Despite the bullish sentiment, if Bitcoin price levels break key support between $9,800 and $9,400 it’s likely to price levels will continue to drop too low $8,000’s. I will also be keeping a close eye on how altcoins act to gauge sensible trades and entries, as stated in more detail within my previous analysis.  On the 2 hour chart, we can see both of the descending channels more clearly. If RSI proceeds upwards from its current level this will be a higher high accompanied by lower lows for BTC’s volume displaying potential bullish divergence. Key resistance levels to look out for if Bitcoin price levels break upwards accompanied by a large volume spike are $10,450, $11,400 (POC), $12,400 and $13,400. It’s likely that a breakout accompanied by a large volume spike will cause price levels to exceed the current yearly high just shy of $14,000. If price levels proceed to break key support at $9,800 I will be looking at the following support levels: $8,400, $7,900, $7,400. However, the sentiment for BTC on all time frames is very much bullish and will remain that way until key support has been clearly broken. The ideal entry point over the coming days is the breakthrough of the descending channel. This will present a low-risk high reward trade opportunity because you know if price levels drop a further 5% after breaking out that the trade objective of running with the market is no longer feasible. Do you think BTC will breakout and head back towards the yearly high around $14,000 before Summer ends? Please leave your thoughts in the comments below!

With the oppressive Beijing regime constantly clamping down on the lives of its people, many are turning to BTC to subvert the system. It is plainly obvious that they would like to, but the ruling party in the People’s Republic of China simply cannot shut down the Bitcoin network. What the state can do is impose strict controls and monitoring of all financial transactions within the country, whether suspicious or not. This blanket surveillance is Orwellian, to say the least, and the Chinese people are looking towards digital assets as a method of circumvention. At the Oslo Freedom Forum, China Uncensored producer Matt Gnaizda sat down with the President of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong Leo Wheese. The first question posed was one of BTC legality in China to which Wheese responded ‘yes’ … but there is no clear definition of what is ‘legal’. He added that any change will happen on the ground first with authorities reacting to crypto organizations and traders before the law changes. As we already know, bitcoin exchanges are already banned and crypto mining operations have been suppressed in China. It was also revealed that the microprocessors for bitcoin mining machines are not manufactured in China. Previously, BTC mining boomed in China due to the prevalence of low-cost power, mostly located in the mountains where hydroelectric power is abundant. Wheese added that bitcoin mining operations still consume around half a percent of the total power consumption but local governments do not appear to be concerned. The central government is more afraid of the hypothetical threat that people can completely circumvent capital controls by using bitcoin. China already has WeChat Pay and AliPay but the government can and do monitor all transactions so BTC becomes a viable alternative for those wanting to transact overseas. Wheese continued to state that bitcoin has also grown in popularity with dissidents or corrupt officials seeking to move money without big brother prying. People in China have been deprived of the opportunity to invest their savings, property markets are deflated, the stock market is seen as a scam, and banks offer few investment tools. The ICO boom was very popular in China where people found a new avenue of investment and bitcoin was used to fuel them. Fearing a loss of control and investor funds, and resultant unrest, the government reacted quickly to ban ICOs. Wheese added that trading crypto in China was still highly active as many see it as a form of gambling. People have been using peer to peer platforms to trade bitcoin since existing platforms can be tracked. There are also capital controls in place to prevent larger sums of money leaving China, the limit is $50,000 per year. BTC helps people that want to move smaller amounts doing so without government snooping. Larger amounts can be sent using bitcoin, an example was payment for overseas education which ordinarily would not be feasible with the state restrictions. Without a central authority, bitcoin cannot be shut down. The government must pursue the individuals instead which is costly and impractical. China is not inclined to ban bitcoin outright for fear of legitimizing it further and attracting more attention, he added. Finally, the anchor asked about the future of bitcoin and whether to invest. There is a growing fear that China will be cut off from the international monetary system so if the yuan is not accepted elsewhere, bitcoin could become the de facto currency. This would benefit individuals and small businesses that can transact globally without the totalitarian regime constantly clamping down on them. This would, of course, increase the demand for BTC in China and across the globe. Will China trigger the next bitcoin bull run?

Havent They?']","  Emilio Janus | Jul 23, 2019 | 09:00 Bakkt yesterday announced the start of user acceptance testing for its Bitcoin daily and monthly futures contracts. “Testing is proceeding as planned with participants from around the world,” it tweeted.  Bakkt had previously announced that user acceptance testing would start on 22 July. So yesterday’s confirmation of this would seem like quite a coup… if this date hadn’t already been postponed multiple times. New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) announced its intention to launch Bakkt in August 2018. At the time, the intended launch date (not user acceptance testing date) was to be November 2018. Rumours of the impending announcement went back as far as May 2018. Towards the end of October 2018, Ice announced that Bakkt would launch one month late, on December 12 2018. The reason for the delay, was that the product was still pending approval from the regulators. A month later, the launch had been pushed back to January 24 2019. Towards the end of December, approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was said to be happening in early 2019. By May, the CFTC’s continued lack of action forced Bakkt to consider a different approach. By self-certifying, the product would be clear to proceed, as long as the CFTC did not raise any objections within ten days. Given the lack of any significant action by the CFTC over the preceding year, it would seem a pretty safe bet that they would be unable to raise a coherent objection in just ten days. User Acceptance Testing would begin in July, it announced. By mid-June, that was pinned down to July 22. Well, if you mean that ICE and Bakkt have finally got round to starting the user acceptance testing, then yes. They’ve done that. We still don’t have a date for the launch or even a timescale for the testing. And that’s in part down to one major stumbling block. Having fallen foul to missing announced launch dates before, Bakkt doesn’t want to go down that path again. Whilst self-certifying may have achieved CFTC approval (by default), there is still a regulatory hurdle to cross. As Bitcoinist pointed out at the time, even a lack of objection by the CFTC didn’t solve the puzzle. A vital part of the Bakkt product is the custodianship, and becoming a qualified custodian requires a permit from the New York State Department of Financial Services. This permit is thus far not forthcoming, and no expected date has been stated. All Bakkt says in its latest blog post is: Subject to regulatory approval, Bakkt’s limited purpose trust company will serve as a qualified custodian for bitcoin. So until this permit is gained we will not be promised any more ‘launch’ dates. Whilst it is great that Bakkt have started UAT on (its latest amended) schedule, Bakkt Futures, and the influx of institutional investors they are hoped to bring, may still be some time off yet. Will we see Bakkt finally launch this year? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below! ","['Bakkt', 'bitcoin', 'btc', 'Futures']"

Earlier in July, the NYAG submitted evidence alleging that Bitfinex provided services to customers based in New York till December 2018, in violation of state law. In response, Monday’s (July 22, 2019) court filing sees Bitfinex accusing the NYAG of misrepresenting the alleged connections to US customers. Bitfinex & Tether fire back, responding to the NY AG's attempts to 'throw everything at the wall' (@bitcoinlawyer's words)https://t.co/fBejvmcig6 — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) July 22, 2019  According to the filing, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel for Tether, revealed that the customers in question were foreign eligible contract participants (ECPs). An excerpt from the filing reads: OAG (Office of the Attorney General) tries to confuse matters by referring to isolated instances where Respondents’ foreign customers have shareholders or other personnel in New York. But in those circumstances, Respondents’ counterparties — the ones with which Respondents actually transacted business — are the foreign entities. Hoegner also argued that the NYAG is attempting to pierce the corporate veil so as to present the ECPs as resident bitcoin traders in the U.S. As reported by Bitcoinist, the NYAG is accusing Bitfinex of covering about $850 million in customer losses. Bitfinex is also challenging the broader jurisdictional authority of the NYAG in the case beyond the matter of servicing U.S. customers. The company’s lawyers say the court lacks both personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the case. On the latter jurisdictional leg, Bitfinex has issued another filing claiming that Tether (USDT) doesn’t qualify as a security or commodity. Thus, it cannot be included in financial fraud litigation under the Martin Act. 3 key points on @bitcoinlawyer (@bitfinex counsel) motion to dismiss NYOAG case:+ Customers in question were foreign ECPs+ Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Bitfinex and @Tether_to + Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under Martin ActSource: https://t.co/uYKQdyYOAd pic.twitter.com/dFDNvwG8Te — Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) July 22, 2019  As such, Bitfinex says the NYAG is attempting to have it both ways — requesting substantive relief while failing to justify the jurisdictional basis for obtaining such relief. The following excerpt from the filing summarizes Bitfinex’s position: OAG wants judicial relief today in the form of discovery and injunction, but cannot be bothered to show that there is a statutory basis for that relief. The Court should reject OAG’s flawed arguments. These new court filings are part of the company’s efforts to have the NYAG’s suit against it thrown out. Back in May, Bitfinex secured a temporary stay of documents in its legal tussle with the NYAG. Hearing on the matter will resume on the matter at the end of July.

America’s largest cryptocurrency trading portal detailed its upside in a document. The paper showed that it had 25 million customers by the end of September 2018. The number went up sharply in 2019, a period which also witnessed an increase in bitcoin prices. As of July 2019, the US exchange had brought about 30 million users to its trading platform. Coinbase has passed 30million users this month(adding 5million users in the last ~10 months)#bitcoin pic.twitter.com/3SNO7HwBxg — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) July 22, 2019  The period also saw Coinbase going through a string of significant in-house developments. In May 2019, the exchange announced that it had expanded its crypto-to-crypto trading operations in over 100 countries. The same time in 2018, Coinbase was available in only 32 states. The platform also listed new cryptocurrencies, including EOS, XRP, and a pool of other altcoins in the same timespan, bringing more communities to its shore. Notably, Coinbase also saw a lower number of hacks, especially around the theft at the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The firm is even shaking hands with regulators in the countries to which it is expanding or planning to expand in. Historically, the number of signups at Coinbase shares an electrifying connection with the bitcoin bull bias. Statistics show that more users joined Coinbase during the price rallies than during the downside actions. Between November 2017 and March 2018, for instance, the US exchange added 7.3 million customers. That was the time when bitcoin price rallied from $8,795 to as high as $19,891, got dumped to $5,873, and prompted an altcoin rally. In the current scenario, the bitcoin price has jumped by more than 180% YTD – from $3,651 to $10,345 at press time. That coincides with the growth in Coinbase’s clientele, meaning more people are willing to interact with the cryptocurrency market. However, the trend on Google shows an apathetic picture. Internet users searching the keyword ‘Coinbase’ has significantly dropped in 2019 from where they were during the 2017 bull run. Coinbase Trend on Google Lower Compared to 2017 Bull Run | Image Credits: Google Trends The vast difference between the trend then-and-now could be due to users’ inclination towards non-US cryptocurrency exchanges. The absence of a clear framework for cryptocurrencies followed by negative remarks from US President Donald Trump, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, could have further slowed down the signups at Coinbase. But, overall, the upside proves that more users are interested in trying out cryptocurrencies.

Popular crypto analyst and economist Saifedean Ammous recently tweeted that any investor crypto investor not holding Bitcoin has already “lost the battle”. According to Ammous, cryptocurrency is “a zero sum game, and if you’re not in Bitcoin you’ve already lost.”  Ammous explained that the majority of altcoins simply copy Bitcoin and wise investors would choose to invest in the Bitcoin, as the digital asset has already rallied more than 300% in 2019.  Ammous’s tweet was also a response to Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali, who tweeted, “You can be long on Bitcoin and support other innovations in crypto. Crypto is not a zero-sum game.” There is validity to Ammous’s conclusion that Bitcoin serves as an inspiration to all other cryptocurrencies, but the blanked statement that all altcoins are mere carbon copies of Bitcoin is a bit off the mark.  Ammous seems to believe that all other cryptocurrencies are “running an old scam” which is akin to money printing rather than innovation. To date, cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Stellar have found significant use cases, and Ripple is used by more than 200 financial institutions around the world. Both the XRapid and XCurrent products offered by Ripple have also helped to legitimize the crypto-sector in the eyes of large banks and remittance houses.  ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees replied to Ammous by saying:  This is just not true. Once chain cannot optimize for all variables and all desired attributes of a digital asset. Thus multiple will exist, and further, while in part competitive, they are also in part complementary and constructive. “Only BTC” is a weaker landscape.  From a developmental point of view, the crypto sector is still in its infancy and the near limitless array of cryptocurrency use cases means that there is plenty of room for the innovations non-Bitcoin networks offer. The ‘Bitcoin over everything’ perspective might be an appropriate phrase for traders but as a payments network there is still room for improvement.  Take for example, Binance DEX recently completed a $1.2 billion transaction using its native BNB token in just 1.1 seconds. All of this was done with a fee of $0.015. While Bitcoin is capable of easily handling these amounts it’s common knowledge that transaction speed is still in need of improvement.  Do you agree or disagree with Ammous?

If you had invested $1,000 in gold at the start of the year, you would have had about $110 in profits, which is not that bad. The same amount invested in Bitcoin would have brought you over $1,640 in profits.  Gold is well-known for its capabilities to preserve value and hedge against inflation. However, top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple have proven to be smarter investment options, at least in the last five years. According to Twitter user @CryptoHandelaar, $1,000 invested in Bitcoin in July 2014 would have generated a return of $14,463 as of early July 2019. On the other end, $1,000 invested in gold under the same conditions would have generated a profit of $41. Gold vs. Crypto: Returns on a $1000$BTC $XRP $LTC pic.twitter.com/rPBjEQOAV5 — CryptoHandelaar (@CryptoHandelaar) July 19, 2019  The worst entry point for Bitcoin holders was in the two months through January 2018. Thus, $1,000 invested at that time would have left you with a negative return. The great thing about gold is that it preserves value indeed, as it hardly fluctuates on large timeframe charts.  Nevertheless, even gold can’t protect you from inflation. Gold’s $41 net profit per $1,000 invested five years ago would still suggest a loss of purchasing power. The US dollar has devalued since 2014 by about 8%. Looking into the future, Bitcoin will continue to secure a higher return on investment. It’s because BTC scarcity is narrowing while gold production is increasing year by year. Gold production has *increased* in each of the last 10 years. Bitcoin production has *decreased* in each of the last 9 years. Which one is truly scarce? pic.twitter.com/CutVKX4OI8 — Kevin Rooke (@kerooke) July 20, 2019  While the increase in gold production doesn’t significantly affect its supply/demand ratio, it still becomes increasingly more available. The worrying thing about the precious metal is a surprise discovery of gold supplies, which could potentially devalue the commodity. For example, last month, the Sun reported that NASA is aiming to reach an asteroid that contains so much gold, plus other metals, that can make every Earth inhabitant a billionaire. On the other side, I don’t think any asteroid or even the aliens can change the maximum supply of Bitcoin. Earlier this month, Bitcoin bull Max Keiser said that rising global debt would see greater capital flow into the oldest cryptocurrency than traditional safe-havens like gold.

Speaking during the 2019 Mid-Year Review Webinar, Barry Silbert, CEO of Grayscale highlighted that there is an imminent generational wealth transfer that could change the dynamics of store of value (SoV) investing in the United States. According to Silbert, the baby boomer generation (between 1951 and 1969) are already beginning to retire. Thus, over the next couple of decades, it’s anticipated that there will be a massive generational wealth transfer.  Commenting on the matter, Silbert opined: “Over next couple of decades, there is $68 trillion of wealth that’s held by baby boomers and the older generation, in the US alone, that’s going to be handed down to Generation X and millenials… My theory is that whatever of that 68 trillion that is currently in gold, I don’t think it’s going to stay all in gold.” For Silbert, millennials and ‘Gen-Z’ are at a pivotal moment where the demographics of generational wealth is about to undergo a significant shift. Bitcoin currently occupies a strong position within this emerging trend as the world’s leading asset class. Bitcoin Max Keiser even believes that there will be an influx of ‘smart money’ into bitcoin. This massive inflow could see bitcoin move 25-30x faster than gold. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, “bitcoin is a demographic mega-trend.” Futhermore, recent surveys also show that bitcoin is fast becoming the most popular investment options for many young Americans. Bitcoin appears perfectly poised to become the preferred investment vehicle for younger investors. It isn’t illogical to posit that a generation that grew up with the internet will be drawn towards the premier digital asset that is BTC. As the older class of investors pass into retirement, millennials will become the dominant investment demographic. Silbert said that of the $68 trillion that the baby boomer generation currently holds in the United States, he expects whatever portion of that money is currently invested in gold is likely to find itself moving across to Bitcoin and other investment opportunities. Doesn’t mean its going to go all into Bitcoin but I do believe that its going to find its way into other asset classes. Bitcoin hasn’t yet reached the fabled trillion-dollar valuation mark. However, if commentators like Silbert are correct, and the generational shift of wealth flows into Bitcoin, it could bring about an unprecedented rise in the asset’s value. There are already several predictions of BTC price reaching $55,000 over the coming years, which would tip BTC’s market capital above the $1 trillion mark. If this plays out it will undeniably cement Bitcoin’s status as the leading SoV asset. Do you think the majority of U.S. millennial investors will put their newfound wealth in bitcoin?

One of the biggest fears is a repeat of the global financial crisis which wiped billions off stock markets and plunged economies into turmoil. The next one could be closer than we think and there are a number of trigger events that may set the avalanche in motion which would lead to a massive reallocation of assets in our financial system. CEO and Co-founder of BnkToTheFuture.com, Simon Dixon, highlighted some of the events that could trigger the next economic collapse. Government debt is out of control in most major global economies which have been using financial markets to borrow excessive amounts of money. The debt is so large now that governments cannot meet their financial liabilities and it has gone into a negative return. There is an ever-increasing debt ceiling in the US as the debts spiral out of control which could trigger another meltdown. A second trigger event could be the stock market which propped up by debt rather than natural consumption. The central bank also injects money into the markets by lending at artificially low rates through schemes such as quantitative easing. With billions entering the economy, some of the larger companies can have excessive profits which enable them to have stock buyback schemes. These could eventually turn investors off the stock and bond markets. A global movement towards discouraging savings has resulted in negative interest rates in many countries. Fractional reserve banking, whereby a bank does not need a deposit to issue a loan, also contributes to excessive debts as does the lack of saving deposits which now costs money under negative rates. Insolvent pension schemes whereby governments do not have enough to meet their obligations could also become a trigger event. Traditionally pension plans have invested in lower-risk asset classes such as bonds but with higher yield sought they will be going into higher risk classes such as stock markets which are artificially propped up by debt. Over-dependence on student loans whereby students were sold the promise that once qualified, a better job would enable them to pay off the debt, has resulted in too many with degrees and masters still deep in a growing debt cycle. Banks also encourage the debt cycle by offering low-interest loans which exacerbates the entire debt crisis. Credit card debt is also on the rise and a lot of people are reallocating loans and mortgages through lower repayment credit card systems with little intention to pay it all off. This could lead to another trigger or systemic risk event in a credit card crisis. An over-dependence on real estate markets could also spark off an economic crisis. Banks, which can print money, rely on lower-risk assets such as property to issue mortgages. Banks were encouraging people with lower credit ratings to take on loans (subprime mortgages) in order to ‘own’ their own property, which also created artificial prices and a false sense of security from those taking the mortgages. Anyone of these trigger events could cause a meltdown in the current financial system which would lead to massive wealth distribution. Bitcoin has a lot going for it with these factors in mind. With its finite supply, approaching halving event, mathematical integrity, immunity from the political and banking systems, and a growing mainstream and institutional interest, BTC could be the place to go when the financial walls tumble down again.

Her initial intent was to create a platform to increase awareness of Bitcoin and blockchain technology in Botswana and Africa. This was at a time when cryptocurrency was still very much a tiny niche counterculture in more developed nations. Since then, it has expanded to provide services as an incubator for startups and entrepreneurs who want to use blockchain to address Africa’s diverse challenges. Through mentorships, training and meet-ups, the centre aims to “build a community of adopters, users, thinkers and coders in Botswana.” In June 2018, SatoshiCentre was one of the founding members of the Botswana Blockchain Association, which is itself part of the Africa Blockchain Alliance. Africa would seem well placed to take advantage of the benefits that Bitcoin has to offer. One of the big reasons for this is the accepted practice of transferring money via smartphone apps. While western cultures must adapt from traditional methods of bank transfer, African nations are already comfortable with such systems. This is, in part, due to the traditional banking structure in many African nations, which leaves many unbanked. As SatoshiCentre say: Bitcoin is permissionless, so, unlike the legacy financial and monetary systems, all of Botswana [and Africa] is free to join. Bitcoin also enables better remittance payment systems, and could help to reduce criminal activity and corruption, which is rife in some African nations. Fortunately, corruption is not a big problem in Botswana as it is one of Africa’s most stable nations. It boasts the continent’s longest continuous multi-party democracy, and has a good human-rights record. Without the concerns of many of its neighbours, the startups here can focus on innovation in entirely new areas, and SatoshiCentre provides a forum to encourage this. They are also not hampered by onerous regulations; the central bank has stated that it currently has no intention of regulating or studying cryptocurrencies. One thing that Botswana doesn’t have is its own cryptocurrency exchange. Locals tend to use WhatsApp or Facebook groups, or have to use South African exchanges. Whilst Botswana mat not have the sizeable Bitcoin communities of Kenya, Nigeria, or South Africa, it has a growing scene working on local solutions and spreading awareness.

The result of fresh research from analysis firm Messari, the giant figure adds to the increasing stack of evidence that cryptocurrency does not play a large role in illicit financial activity worldwide.  According to Messari, which released its findings on July 16, for every $1 dollar in BTC spent on the darknet, $800 in fiat is laundered.  The company said it decided to produce the statistics as a direct response to recent criticism of Bitcoin by politicians, specifically in the US, where Congress held several hearings dedicated to cryptocurrency last week.   As Bitcoinist reported, testimony from lawmakers featured the full spectrum of cliches regarding Bitcoin, with naysayers repeatedly focusing on perceived criminal activity.  Despite multiple research projects concluding the risk Bitcoin poses to financial stability due to money laundering is negligible, politicians continue to claim the threat is much larger.  At Congress, it was Brad Sherman who threw his weight behind the argument, following in the footsteps of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and, previously, President Donald Trump. Specific scorn came in for Facebook’s digital currency project, Libra, which Sherman claimed could even form the basis of a 9/11 style terrorist attack. He said,  If cryptocurrency is used to finance the next horrific terrorist attack, 100 lawyers standing in a row, charging $200,000 an hour, are not going to protect his rear end from the wrath of the American people Sherman fuelled a general backlash among the cryptocurrency industry on social media, with posts appearing which showed the extent of his and others’ misguidedness.  The Congressman had claimed $76 billion was laundered in Bitcoin annually. Pierre Rochard, one of cryptocurrency’s more outspoken proponents, subsequently cited research from Blockchain firm Chainalysis, which conversely concluded the figure was tiny, with 2017’s total reaching just $660 million.  Fellow commentator, Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano, noted that $2 trillion of USD is laundered per year – more than 6.5 times the entire cryptocurrency market cap.  “Bitcoin will reduce money laundering globally, which is exactly why certain people and organizations are fighting it so hard,” he added. Beyond the US, in India, where the concept of Bitcoin fuelling money laundering makes regular appearances in public literature, the tide also appears to be turning in government. While an alleged draft law earlier this month contained details of a blanket ban on cryptocurrency, the country’s finance minister last week gave the opposite impression, confirming regulatory preparations were underway which would legitimize the industry.

Separately, an earlier survey, commissioned by Fidelity Investments, concluded that 47 percent of institutional investors see crypto-assets as part of their portfolios. SSRS conducted the survey on behalf of Bankrate.com to identify America’s most popular long-term investments. Thus, researchers posed the following question: “For money, you wouldn’t need for more than ten years, which one of the following do you think would be the best way to invest it?” The options were: real estate, stocks, cash investments, gold/metals, bonds, none, and Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies. As a result, four percent of the people surveyed responded that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were the best investment option for the long term. For most Americans, 31 percent, real estate was their favorite long-term investments, as the table below shows.  The survey comprised a sample size of 1,015 respondents. Fieldwork was undertaken between June 25 and 30, 2019. The trend to consider Bitcoin as an investment is gaining momentum. In this connection, the SSRS survey seems to be in line with the conclusions reached by a Fidelity commissioned study. It only focused on Wall Street investors and took place in May 2019. This survey concluded that 47 percent of institutional investors “view digital assets as having a place in their investment portfolios.” The breakdown is as follows, • 72% prefer to buy investment products that hold digital assets • 57% prefer to buy crypto assets directly • 57% prefer to buy an investment product that holds digital asset companies. Moreover, the SSRS study confirmed that Bitcoin and other crypto-assets are more popular among younger people. According to the researchers, “Millennials picked cryptocurrencies as their top long-term investment about 9 percent of the time – about triple the rate of Generation X. Earlier generations had negligible numbers of respondents selecting virtual currency as their top choice.”  Incidentally, the SSRS survey conclusions agree with Harris Post survey, which concluded “59% of those aged 18–34 ‘strongly’ or ‘somewhat’ agree that Bitcoin is a positive innovation in financial technology — up 11 percentage points from October 2017.” Which is your favorite long-term investment?

Traders are anxiously awaiting a decision as BTC continues within a tight trading range. On the 4 Hour chart, we can see how Bitcoin price is developing since the breakout point on the 18th of July. It’s no surprise that throughout this weekend volume has been low, and as a result the price action has been trading within a tight range. Maxx Momentum indicator, which is very similar to the MACD indicator, has now convincingly crossed to the upside despite the low volume. This indicates that bulls are back in control for now. Monday will be an extremely important day as this is typically when volume rushes back into the market and consolidation throughout the weekend comes to an end. This usually results in a big move which sets the tone for the rest of the week. We should expect to see a pull-back to key support at $10,100 before a continuation of the bullish trend. There’s an expectation of bullish continuation due to the breakout of the descending channel. More information on what to expect during a typical Monday’s trading session can be found here. For now, it seems no matter what direction of how volatile/docile BTC’s price action is, altcoins are continuing to create lower lows resulting in little to no tradeable opportunities.  On the 1 Hour chart, we can see both the 50 MA and 200 EMA are moving extremely close to each other, which has been very uncommon throughout the last few months on BTC. This is usually a strong indication of suppression, and a big move ahead. It’s quite hard to gauge which direction this will take Bitcoin price. The consensus and overall trend are still clearly bullish until key support at $8,800 is broken as mentioned in the previous analysis. Maxx Momentum is trading very close to the median 0.0 line which aligns nicely with how close both the moving averages are trading in comparison to one another. Given this is all unfolding around the hourly POC at $10,500, this fills me with complete confidence that next week there will be a clear decision as to which direction BTC will be heading for the remainder of July.

But did the week’s crypto news give any indication of ‘When Moon?’ for Bitcoin?  So it’s been another week of consolidation for bitcoin price, which is never a bad thing long term. Let’s have a look at how it unfolded. The week started somewhat perilously, as whales tried to shake out weak hands, and price dipped briefly back below $10k. Still, this did present a great buying opportunity for anyone who thought they had missed their chance at a sub-10k bitcoin. By Tuesday, things seemed to be on the mend again though as price broke out of a bullish falling wedge and climbed back towards $11,000. However, the optimism was short-lived, as on Wednesday another crash saw BTC trading in the low $9000 levels. Despite concerns of further losses, resistance held and price bounced back to five figures on Thursday. A study showing that price is most volatile between midnight and 1am UTC had traders reconsidering their sleep patterns. The consensus is that bitcoin will not return to 2019 lows, based on mining costs. This, despite concerns that US President Donald Trump may feel that he has to be seen to act against Bitcoin in defence of the dollar. Although apparently he can’t ban Bitcoin because source code is speech. John McAfee was still positive about his $1m by 2020 prediction anyway. So we can all rest easy and anyone who bought the dip can consider it a steal. Part of Bitcoin’s current volatility is down to the US Senate’s investigation into Facebook’s Libra. There were not one, but two hearings where Senators tried to get to the bottom of what exactly Libra was supposed to be. Few had positive feelings on the whole affair, and Bitcoin got somewhat dragged into the argument, but did gain some fans who understood the difference. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticised Libra for calling itself decentralised, when in fact it is controlled by ‘largely massive corporations‘. One congressman correctly identified Libra as a ‘sh*tcoin’, after which Google searches for the term skyrocketed. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was wheeling out the tired old rhetoric about Bitcoin (and Libra) posing an increased risk for money-laundering. However, further analysis suggested that Mnuchin did appreciate Bitcoin’s as a store of value, and understood that Libra is a very different beast. He closed the week promising strong regulation to prevent Bitcoin becoming “the equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts.” On the other side of the world in India, a draft law appeared set to prohibit use of Bitcoin and crypto other than the proposed ‘digital rupee’. However a government spokesman later clarified this, saying no coin was illegal and regulations were coming. So nothing’s changed there as of now. Japanese exchange, Bitpoint, announced an additional $2.3 million had been lost in last week’s hack. Then later pledged that all $30 million stolen in total would be returned to customers. $73 million worth of BTC was pulled from Bitmex after reports it was to be investigated by the CFTC over allegedly providing service to American traders. Tron CEO, Justin Sun, announced the name of another guest he will bring to next week’s charity lunch with Warren Buffett. Circle CEO, Jeremy Allaire will join Charlie Lee, Sun and Buffett, with four golden tickets still to be distributed. A report revealed that the number of Bitcoin SV transactions is growing… but that 96% of all transactions on the network are generated by a weather app. Still not sure ‘whether’ SV is Satoshi’s Vision of bitcoin? Seriously Vexing. What do you think about the topics discussed in this week’s roundup?

This followed reports that the CFTC was investigating the exchange for allegedly servicing US traders.  The outflows were first reported in a tweet from London-based Token Analyst. Most of the listed exchanges (Binance, Bitstamp, Bittrex, and Poloniex) have similar amounts flowing both in and out. However Bitmex is notable for its disparity, with only $12 million coming in, whilst $85 million has flowed out. 🚨 24H BTC exchange on-chain flows:#binance: $58M in | $54M out#bitstamp: $52M in | $50M out#bittrex: $4M in | $5M out#poloniex: $6M in | $4M out#bitmex: $12M in | $85M out See more at https://t.co/6AFFM1D63p — TokenAnalyst (@thetokenanalyst) July 20, 2019  Some speculated that this was due to panic leaving. News broke yesterday that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is allegedly investigating the exchange. However, many countered that considering the volume of BTC on the Bitmex platform, it perhaps wasn’t such a being deal. Certainly there is historical precedence for these kind of figures.  Well, the reported CFTC investigation revolves around whether Bitmex was providing services to US traders. Because cryptocurrencies were ruled to be commodities in the US, any platform allowing trading by US citizens needs to be CFTC-registered. The platform’s terms of service do list the US as a restricted jurisdiction, and customers have reported that their accounts have been shut down on suspicion that they were US customers. However most cryptocurrency traders would have no problem setting up a VPN in order to get around geo-blocking or other such restrictions. In fact, Binance CEO, CZ, is among many who advocate for the use of VPNs at all times online. In which case, is the exchange at fault or the trader? It is possible that the recent out-flows from Bitmex represent American traders withdrawing funds from the exchange in order to keep them from the CFTC. However this is by no means certain. Additionally, though some suggest that this amount of BTC will find its way onto the spot markets, there is nothing to really indicate that this is the case. It is likely that much of this liquidity will find its way onto other exchanges or even hardware wallets. Even if it were to be sold off, that sort of amount shouldn’t cause a substantial dip in BTC price. What do you think about Bitmex’s recent outflows?

There’s a new website dedicated to the salaries of athletes and celebrities, converted into Bitcoin. Including that of everybody’s favorite practitioner of self-admiration, Cristiano Ronaldo. Just two months ago, Bitcoinist reported on a groundswell of interest from NFL players, asking teams to ‘Pay Me In Bitcoin’. Led by Russell Okung, of the LA Chargers, this interesting proposal never actually came to any satisfying conclusion. Nevertheless, it did spark the imagination. So much so, that there is now a website and subreddit dedicated to sourcing the salaries of athletes and celebrities and converting them into Bitcoin. New names are added regularly, and fans get to make suggestions of who to add next via Twitter. The chart is currently dominated by sports stars. This is in part down to the relative lack of non-athletes so far nominated. The top three salaries listed are all from the footballing world (or soccer, if you’re that way inclined). Juventus player, Ronaldo, comes in second, which must eat into him as much as it cheers up the rest of us. His $109 million yearly salary (including endorsements), currently equates to 10,274.5 BTC, although he isn’t currently a Bitcoin fan. Top earner, Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, is, however, and if he received all earnings in bitcoin, it would amount to 11,971 BTC. Third place is Brazilian, Neymar, although if he keeps missing training at Paris St. Germain then he won’t stay there for long. Other sports stars in the top ten are American football star, Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks (8436 BTC), and Basketball legend LeBron James (8389 BTC). Although none of these are listed as being into crypto. Okung currently sits in 58th place, earning a potential 1270 BTC per year at today’s prices As mentioned, celebrities from outside of the sporting world are currently under-represented, perhaps because the list initially focussed solely on sports stars. However, names from the world of entertainment are making their way onto the list. Current leader, and technically just inside the top ten, is Kim Kardashian (although entertainment might be stretching it a little). Her estimated $72 million yearly income, equates to 6790 BTC. Then we have Pirates of the Caribbean star, Johnny Depp in 35th on 3,100 BTC, and rapper 50 Cent at number 44 on 2,830 BTC. Depp is not known to be a bit coiner, but 50 Cent is. We also have Gwyneth Paltrow, who is very definitely into cryptocurrency, being an advisor to Abra, in 54th place on 1,890. It’s all ‘not very exact’, and hopefully the sports bias will start to correct over time, but it’s a mildly amusing diversion. Incidentally, Warren Buffett, who has recently been nominated, would sit just under Kim Kardashian, with his $66 million earnings (6230 BTC). You can make your own jokes up about that. Buffett is not a Bitcoiner. How much does your favorite celebrity make in Bitcoin? Do let us know in the comments below! ","['bitcoin', 'cristiano ronaldo', 'lionel messi', 'Soccer']"

Earlier this week Macro Risk Advisors chief technical analyst John Kolovos spoke with Bloomberg TV about Bitcoin price action and the recent Congressional and Senate hearings over Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency. According to Kolovos, Bitcoin price is “going through a corrective process” and he placed emphasis on “process” in order to clarify that he does not believe Bitcoin is going through a trend changing correction.  Kolovos explained that Bitcoin price is currently going through the motions of a classic ABCD correction and finding support around $9,000. Kolovos suggests that Bitcoin is nearly on the verge of stabilizing but cautioned that before this happens the digital asset is in for a more downside followed by choppy consolidation.  John Kolovos: Bitcoin Futures Are A Great Buy At $8500 Currently, Bitcoin price is finding support at the 50-day moving average but the presence of an M top (double top) formation could continue to attract bears. Additionally, the RSI still has room to drop before a healthy bounce. During the 2017 bull run, an RSI reading of 40 proved to be a reliable bounce point that attracted buyers.  When asked about his thoughts on why the double top will complete at $8,500 to $9,000 instead of Bloomberg’s forecast that Bitcoin price could drop to or below $7,000, Kolvos outlined the following:                                                    John Kolovos: Bitcoin Has A Bullish Outlook In Long Term Kolovos also explained that bulls are clearly in charge as Bitcoin is above the 50-week moving average and the break above the descending wedge in April 2019 was a clear indicator of the resumption of the long-term uptrend. Kolovos said: Classic technical analysis tells you that this pattern, implication of which, gets you back to the old highs, which would be around $20,000. So the long-term trend tells me to buy the pullbacks so that’s the reason why I think we should be buying around $8,500.  At the time of publishing, Bitcoin price is holding above $10,000 and trading in a tightening range between $10,300 – $10,600. Price action has been relatively choppy throughout this week and the current rumor that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is investigating BitMex for allowing U.S. residents to use the platform has shaken traders interim confidence in the crypto-market. In 2019 weekends have tended to witness whipsaw volatility from Bitcoin so the next 48-hours could see a series of decisive moves from Bitcoin.  Do you think Kolovos is on the money about his $8,500 Bitcoin price prediction?

You Like Bitcoin.', 'How Does it Work?']","  Emilio Janus | Jul 19, 2019 | 16:00 If you always hit a brick wall when explaining Bitcoin to friends and family then you may be in luck. A Twitter user known only as ‘Pedro’ is developing a Bitcoin-based board game called ‘Hodler of Last Resort‘.  Pedro has designed the game to mimic Bitcoin’s incentives system and consensus rules as much as possible. Events resonate with real-world consequences for actions within and around the Bitcoin network. Whilst the game is still in development, the draft game board already exists and the mechanic is defined. Each turn represents 52,500 blocks and there is a block reward of 50BTC per block, halving every four turns. Only one player moves their counter around the board during a turn, but all players mine for Bitcoin using various amounts of coloured dice. Obviously having more hash-power (dice) gives a player a greater chance of mining the block and winning the reward, by rolling the lowest number on a single die.  A player can land on squares triggering events such as trading, network or exchange attacks, or improving their Bitcoin habits. There will also be cards for mining, security, knowledge and trading. The goal is to end the game with all the available bitcoin. Admittedly, the two things couldn’t seem to be more at odds; a virtual digital currency in a physical board game? Do you own in-game physical bitcoin, à la Monopoly money? Well, no. That wouldn’t work very well, as its very difficult to divide a paper bitcoin into satoshis… amongst other reasons. Instead the game requires a spreadsheet to deal with the accounting. From the looks of things, this has been programmed to be as easy-to-use as possible, simply entering details of each turn’s mining block reward winner, and the square landed on by the player and consequences. But this may still make it a little less appealing to board-game purists. After all, you don’t really want to have a laptop or tablet to hand whilst you’re playing board games. Still, here at Bitcoinist we’re all for spreading the good word of Bitcoin far and wide, so applaud Pedro and wish him luck in his efforts. What do you think of this new board game concept?

Price action tested the 50MA in today’s trading session and could propel price levels above $11,000.  On the 4 Hour chart, we can see the downtrend over the last 9 days formed a descending channel that was broken to the upside less than 48 hours ago. Since then, Bitcoin price levels have retested support at $10,120 whilst POC moves up to $10,560 around current market price indicating there’s a good amount of support around the current market price. The 200EMA is running through the same levels as POC with 50MA closely behind. Both moving averages are the closest they have been to each other in well over a month, this leads me to firmly believe there’s strong support around $10,300. Typically, when both moving averages are so close together after a period of volatility it’s a sign of further volatility to come. This will most likely be kickstarted by an explosive move in any direction, as the trend is still bullish after BTC held above the key support at $8,800. It’s likely that if an explosive move does happen it will likely be to the up-side, but that’s wishful thinking of course. On the Hourly chart, we can see the most recent breakout of the descending channel and the large volume that accompanied this move. Since the breakout price levels have been trading close to POC (Point of Control) at $10,600. Recent retest of the 50MA highlighted on the chart resulting in a strong wick is a sign that bulls are still in control, and Bitcoin price levels will likely move up further over the rest of the intra-day trading session. Both the 200EMA and 50MA are clearly sandwiching the price action, similar to what we can see on the 4 Hour analysis above. This is a strong sign of suppression, which is also evident by the very short-headed candles with large wicks. This simply means that bots and whales are fighting for price levels to remain in a tight trading range in the short-term. Providing BTC see’s further upside over the coming days and weeks, key resistance levels to look out for are $10,600, $11,080, $11,900 and $13,270.

Supply Down 92% YTD,"['Gemini Dollar Falls Behind', 'Competition is a Killer', 'The Great Gemini Dollar Rebound']","  davitbabayan | Jul 19, 2019 | 13:00 Demand for Gemini exchange’s native stablecoin, Gemini dollar (GUSD), has dropped significantly over the last 7 months while other pegged-value assets continue to soar. The market capitalization of the dollar-pegged token has been on its way down since December 20, 2018. It has slipped from an all-time high of $103.106 million to $7.981 million at the time of this writing, marking a 92.25% drop in just seven months. The same period has witnessed the bitcoin price soaring from $3,126 to $10,336.17, up by more than 230 percent. Gemini Market Cap is on a Steady Decline | Image Credits: CoinMarketCap.com In contrast, other stablecoins are faring far better than Gemini Dollar. Paxos Standard Token, for instance, has a market capitalization of circa $168 million. At the same time, Circle’s USDC is towering high at a supply of circa 406.34 million. Last but not least, the leading stablecoin Tether (USDT) has a total quantity of $4.25 billion, calculated at press time. In comparison to its peers in the United States, Gemini exchange notices less trade traffic on its platform. Data provided by CoinGecko shows that the Winklevoss Twins’ firm is on the 21st rank in the last 24 hours – with just $60.275 million in daily volume. Coinbase Pro, another US-regulated entity, is hosting about $602.93 million worth of trades on its exchange – 10X the number of trading volume that Gemini is reporting. At the same time, San Francisco-based Kraken exchange is processing $340.30 million worth of trades on its platform. The absence of an adequate competitive edge could be one of the reasons why the demand for Gemini dollar could be dropping. As a dollar-pegged entity, the token allows traders to switch between crypto-assets smoothly without having to convert their cryptocurrencies to the US dollar. As it appears, not many traders demand GUSD, which could be due to Gemini’s presence in a strictly regulated financial market. Union Station, Washington DC, @Gemini ads plaster the walls. We’re growing 🚀 pic.twitter.com/3BJQEgXr7w — Crypto Gumb 🇺🇸 (@derekGUMB) July 18, 2019  There are other competitive factors in play, meanwhile. Tether’s USDT is more visible across the non-US exchanges, especially Binance, despite its contentious status. USDC, on the other hand, has a broader clientele in Coinbase and Circle. Paxos is extra-feasible for its ability to create and redeem stablecoins instantly. And above all, even the traders outside the Gemini exchange are not keeping many Gemini dollars in their profiles. The community believes it is because of a rebate program Gemini introduced at the time of the launch of GUSD. The firm offered trading companies its stablecoins in discounts in hopes to reduce Tether’s market dominance. But it appears those companies exchanged stockpiles of discounted GUSD units one-to-one for Tether’s USDT and other stablecoins, thus earning free money. The demand for Gemini Dollar could go up as founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss prepares Gemini to become a broker-dealer. The twins have applied for a license at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Upon approval, Gemini would be able to offer to trade in securities, which could boost the demand for GUSD.

According to Bloomberg, anonymous sources say the U.S. regulatory watchdog is investigating the popular bitcoin exchange. Reports indicate that the probe centers around BitMEX allowing U.S. traders on the platform. CFTC to probe whether @BitMEXdotcom broke rules of allowing Americans to trade — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) July 19, 2019  BitMEX isn’t a CFTC-registered platform, thus it is illegal for Americans to trade the crypto derivatives listed on the bitcoin exchange. The CFTC’s regulatory ambit over cryptos come from a federal ruling back in 2018 declaring cryptos to be commodities. Because of this, the Commission has jurisdiction over any avenue where crypto-based derivatives might intersect with U.S.-based traders even concerning platforms based abroad. Reacting to the development, a spokesperson for the bitcoin exchange told Bloomberg: HDR Global Trading Limited, owner of BitMEX, as a matter of company policy, does not comment on any media reports about inquiries or investigations by government agencies or regulators and we have no comment on this report. The platform’s terms of service do include a list of restricted jurisdictions from whence trading isn’t permitted. Apart from the U.S. other banned countries are Iran, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea to mention a few. There are reports of user accounts terminated on the platform based on the suspicion that they were U.S. customers. Noted bitcoin bear Tone Vays even tweeted in late 2018, alleging that BitMEX had shut down his account for the same reason. The news of the CFTC investigation into BitMEX also comes as popular nocoiner Nouriel Roubini accused the bitcoin exchange of systematic illegality.

Exchanges like Bittrex and Poloniex are increasingly adopting robust know-your-customer (KYC) protocols in a bid to avoid sharing the same fate as Bitmex. Apart from KYC, some exchanges have also even begun to geo-block U.S. traders from certain trading pairs. As reported by Bitcoinist, both Binance and Poloniex have been forced to geofence several cryptocurrency tokens from U.S. traders. In response, several commentators say traders should use VPNs to get around such geographic restrictions. Meanwhile, bitcoin exchange stakeholders say unclear regulations are constituting a stumbling block to digital innovation in the U.S. Should BitMEX be liable for the actions of U.S. traders who employ IP-masking tools to get around geographical trading restrictions on bitcoin exchanges?

While the court ultimately ruled against a request for compensation from Wu over missing funds, the decision to give status to Bitcoin is significant, Wan argues. “This case is a major milestone,” she commented, summarizing that the court had de facto confirmed Bitcoin is legal in China.  The Hangzhou case follows on from a previous legal ruling in October 2018, when the Shenzhen Arbitration Commission similarly deemed Bitcoin should receive legal protection as property.  China’s approach to cryptocurrency thus continues to present contradictory conclusions for residents.  As Bitcoinist reported, the government implemented a ban on trading any form of cryptocurrency in September 2017, a policy which remains despite the two judgements.  In comments to local newspaper Global Times this week, the country’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), further added to the mixed messages. An official validated the Hangzhou ruling, while appearing to avoid its possible implications for Bitcoin use. “Indeed, Bitcoin is virtual property, but it’s not fiat money,” they told the publication.  The PBoC’s reaction to Facebook’s Libra digital currency project further complicated matters. Last week, it emerged that the bank was working on a digital currency of its own, with statements voicing concern about Libra’s potential to corrupt markets by being pegged to the US dollar.  “If the digital currency is closely associated with the US dollar, it could create a scenario under which sovereign currencies would coexist with US dollar-centric digital currencies,” Wang Xin, director of the People’s Bank of China’s research bureau, said during a Q&A session.  “But there would be in essence one boss, that is the US dollar and the United States.

Additionally, despite the April 2019 bear market, Americans, especially young people, are more willing to buy the cryptocurrency in the next five years.  Blockchain Capital asked The Harris Poll research firm to conduct a study comprising a sample of 2,209 American adults, in April 2019. The survey was an extension of a 2017 survey which measured Americans’ general sentiment toward Bitcoin. It inquired about a wide range of attributes: awareness, familiarity, perception, conviction, and propensity to buy the cryptocurrency.  Additionally, researchers studied Bitcoin preference rates and BTC ownership. All of the survey indicators showed that younger people are driving the #1 cryptocurrency’s trajectory. Specifically, the survey concludes, The results highlight that Bitcoin is a demographic mega-trend led by younger age groups. The only area where older demographics matched younger demographics was awareness: Regardless of age, the vast majority of the American population has heard of Bitcoin. bitcoin Spencer Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital, points out that the 2017 survey was conducted in a bullish market. And this survey was taken between 22 and 25 April 2019, in a bear market. Bogart writes, Despite the bear market, the data shows that Bitcoin awareness, familiarity, perception, conviction, propensity to purchase and ownership all increased/improved significantly — dramatically in many cases. bitcoin For example, Bitcoin’s familiarity rose to 43 percent in April 2019 from 30 percent in October 2017. Most notably, it rose to 60 percent from 42 percent among people between the ages of 18 to 34. Similarly, researchers concluded that younger people have a favorable view of the cryptocurrency. 59% of those aged 18–34 ‘strongly’ or ‘somewhat’ agree that ‘ Bitcoin is a positive innovation in financial technology — up 11 percentage points from October 2017. bitcoin Moreover, the propensity to buy BTC also increased in 2019. People willing to buy rose from 19% in October 2017 to 27% in April 2019. Indeed, among younger people, the propensity to buy the cryptocurrency increased by 10 percent. bitcoin Separately, an SSRS survey recently confirmed The Harris Poll survey findings. Bitcoin and other crypto-assets are more popular among younger people. The SSRS conducted a study on behalf of Bankrate.com, on June 25 to 30 June 2019.

According to the survey, four percent of Americans consider cryptocurrencies as the best way to invest for the long-term. And, the study found, Millennials picked cryptocurrencies as their top long-term investment about 9 percent of the time – about triple the rate of Generation X.

Responding to a request for clarity on the state’s view of cryptocurrency, Anurag Thakur, India’s Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs, firmly denied any token was illegal.  The comments contradict the content of an alleged draft law which surfaced last week, which outlined plans for a blanket ban on cryptocurrency and prison sentences for its use.  The document, which appeared online from a local lawyer, appeared to form the basis of the queries to Thakur, who nonetheless did not refer to its contents explicitly. “No, Sir,” he replied when asked whether the government “has prohibited cryptocurrency.” “Taking note of the issue, the Government has constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) under the Chairmanship of Secretary (EA). The IMC has submitted the Report to the Government,” he continued. As Bitcoinist reported, India continues to find itself in a state of flux after highly-mixed messages from authorities and the central bank.  In July 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forbade banks from serving cryptocurrency businesses, resulting in shutdowns for some and exodus overseas for others. The draft bill, which has not seen recognition, made further reference to the creation of a digital rupee, which its author or authors said would become India’s only legally-allowed domestic digital currency.  The industry has meanwhile sought to overturn the RBI ban via the courts, a process which appears to have run into multiple delays.  Summarizing, Thakur struck a cautious tone, signaling that existing rules applied to cryptocurrency while Delhi thrashed out new regulations. “Presently, there is no separate law for dealing with issues relating to cryptocurrencies. Hence, all concerned Departments and law enforcement agencies, such as RBI, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax authorities, etc. take action as per the relevant existing laws,” he confirmed. “Similarly, police/courts take action on IPC offenses. Further, in view of the risks and dangers associated with cryptocurrencies, Government and RBI have been issuing advisories, press releases, and circulars to the public.” His words saw a warm welcome among the local cryptocurrency industry, with Nischal Shetty, CEO of exchange WazirX, saying the government was taking “careful steps forward.” The government saw direct backlash when the draft law emerged, with investor Tim Draper openly calling it “pathetic and corrupt” for allegedly suggesting the ban.

As the US Congress and Senate hearings on Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency wrapped up, members of the Trump administration shifted their gaze onto Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a whole. During both hearings a number of lawmakers openly aired their opinion that Libra should never be allowed to launch. Even more concerning, on Thursday US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made media waves when he told CNBC Squawk Box that the U.S. government intends to implement “very, very, strong” regulations on cryptocurrencies to ensure they do not become “Swiss-numbered bank accounts”.   For cryptocurrency investors, these mutterings generated mixed emotions and some are fearful that the government generated FUD could put a permanent dent in what many are interpreting as the start of a bull market.  Fundstrat head analyst Thomas Lee appears to share in these fears and over the past 3 days, Lee posted tweets outlining his fear that Bitcoin’s 5 minutes of fame could expose it to the ire of President Trump. According to Lee, Bitcoin price action is likely to remain “choppy” until the media and legislative focus shift on to other matters.  Lee believes that the current Bitcoin coverage is turning into “too much of a good thing” and he advised that more Bitcoin beneficial chatter surrounding Brexit, the China trade war, and European bank issues need to make news headlines. On July 13, Lee tweeted a screenshot a section of the official U.S. ban on the Venezuelan Petro and he placed extra emphasis on the following section: any digital coin, or digital token, what was issued by, for, on behalf of the Government of Venezuela on or after January 9, 2018, are prohibited as of the effective of this order.   According to Lee, while highly unlikely, the President could easily sign an executive order to ban Bitcoin and cryptocurrency transactions in the United States just like he did for Venezuela. Without providing much explanation, Lee concluded that such a drastic move would probably result in a Bitcoin fork.  Despite these worries, Lee is still confident that now is the time to be invested in Bitcoin and he ends his tweet with #BTFD and #cryptowinter over. Interestingly, during the hearings Bitcoin slowly dropped to $9,100 but in the early trading hours on Thursday the digital asset managed a $1,000 upside move in a little over 30 minutes. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades slightly above $10,600 and traders are hopeful that the cryptocurrency can reenter the $11,200 to $11,500 range over the next 24-hours.  Do you think the Trump Administration will make cryptocurrency regulation a priority?

What about the dollar?']","  Eustace Cryptus | Jul 18, 2019 | 17:00 Now that the U.S. Congress and Senate have finished their hearings with Facebook, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has set his regulatory sights on Bitcoin.  It appears that the aftermath of the US Congress and Senate Banking Committee’ hearings on Facebook’s Libra coin could present a new set of regulatory problems for cryptocurrency as a whole. On Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin promised that the U.S. will police cryptocurrencies with “very, very strong” regulations and he pledged that under his watch, We’re going to make sure that Bitcoin doesn’t become the equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts.   According to Mnuchin, stringent regulation will ensure that cryptocurrency transactions remain transparent and prevent them from posing the same sort of shadow banking risks that the Swiss system facilitates. Mnuchin told CNBC’s Squawk Box:  I want to be careful that anybody who’s using Bitcoin regardless of what the price is – is using it for proper purposes and not illicit purposes.” Mnuchin also said that “there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.” There is a degree of credibility to Mnuchin’s concerns as there are numerous instances of Swiss banks offering clients shadowy banking services through the provision of numbered accounts which are only known to the account holder and a small circle of bankers.  When asked whether Bitcoin’s use as the go-to currency for brokering illegal transactions strikes it off as a legitimate currency, Mnuchin said:  I don’t think that’s accurate at all, that cash is laundered all the time. We combat bad actors in the U.S dollar every day to protect the U.S. financial system.”  Cryptocurrencies have come under the spotlight this week as both legislative houses of the US government look into the exact nature of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency. Google searches for Bitcoin are on the rise and most notably, searches for ‘Shitcoins’ have exploded after Congressman Warren Davidson used the term during yesterday’s Congressional Libra hearing.

Speaking to CNBC, Meltem Demirors, Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at CoinShares, highlighted the already regulated nature of the bitcoin space. Exchanges and wallet providers have to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) provisions in different jurisdictions. This reality contrasts greatly with the usual soundbites espoused by the anti-bitcoin crowd.

The CoinShares CSO also highlighted the fact that Libra’s emergence seems to have cast bitcoin in a clearer light. Thus, instead of over-regulating the market, bitcoin and cryptos can be given a similarly enabling legal compliance environment like the early internet days. Concerning Libra, Demirors expressed delight at the fact that lawmakers seemed to understand that it wasn’t a cryptocurrency. Given the centralized nature of Facebook’s business and the contents of the project white paper, it goes without saying that Libra is at best a pseudo-cryptocurrency. There have also been some concerns over whether Libra’s emergence could cause an increase in regulations that could stifle bitcoin innovation. Commenting on the matter, Demirors opined: I think the concern of everyone in this hearing is the fact that Facebook has such tremendous size and such a massive impact on the digital economy. So, there are questions about systemic risks, and who the members of the consortium are. That’s really what lawmakers are trying to untangle. Outside of Libra, Demirors believes the U.S. Congress needs to move forward with creating a clearly defined regulatory regime for bitcoin and cryptos in general. Regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have consistently shown an unwillingness to reinvent the wheel when dealing with crypto laws. The CoinShares CSO also shares the view that the U.S. could get left behind in the developing landscape of the evolving global digital economy. These new laws also have to protect smaller startups who might not have the resources required to comply with stringent regulations.

With Bitcoin price on the rise, it’s fair to suggest that blockchain startups are out this year and Bitcoin is back in.  One of the great things about Bitcoin is that even critics could generally see value in its underlying blockchain technology. The ‘Blockchain not Bitcoin’ mantra was repeated often and everywhere, much to the chagrin of Bitcoin maximalists. As bitcoin price exploded through the second half of 2017, everything blockchain related came with it. Then, during the crypto-winter of 2018, as people exited bitcoin in droves, DLT technology was the thing to cling on to. Bitcoin was just one tiny application of the nascent fintech. Alibaba CEO, Jack Ma, claimed that, although Bitcoin was a bubble, blockchain was not, and his company would focus solely on blockchain. Even the notoriously crypto-hostile Chinese government wanted to dominate the blockchain scene. While ICOs were falling out of favour, and cryptocurrencies were shedding value like it was going out of style, venture capital investments in blockchain startups hit a record high of $4.1 billion in 2018. Bitcoin’s rebound from December 2018 lows has come at a time when new data suggests investment into blockchain startups is dropping. The the first half of 2019 saw just 227 deals between traditional venture capitalists and crypto startups. According to CB Insights, the level of investment has totalled just $784 million.  That would give a projected figure for the whole of 2019 of around $1.6 billion, representing a drop of over 60% on 2018 levels. Further insights from the report suggest that inflows of cash from corporations are on ‘an even sharper decline,’ and that ‘a growing share of [the investment which is happening] is going to early-stage startups’. ICOs have been out funded by venture capital for four straight quarters, although both are declining. Meanwhile increasing BTC price 00 and market cap suggests renewed interest in the space. blockchain bitcoin So it seems we are back to ‘Bitcoin not blockchain’, which will keep the maximalists happy, at least. There is certainly an increased sense of optimism in the cryptocurrency space, with keystone currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum seeing speculation and volume surge in recent months. Corporate interest from the likes of Facebook, Visa and JP Morgan has seen renewed enthusiasm, giving the blockchain space a second wind. This is likely to also be good news for startups, who are well positioned to help larger corporations and institutions enter the market. Whether that spells a renewed interest in venture capital, however, remains to be seen. What do you think of these latest findings?

Was Arthur Hayes’s exchange the orchestrator of the latest flash crash? It’s been a harrowing week for Bitcoin bulls as the markets peaked at over $13000 last Wednesday and have stepped down a little further almost each day since.   In the space of a few days, BTC lost almost $4000 from its value. On Sunday, July 15th, there was a massive sell-off that triggered a flash crash and subsequent huge amount of liquidations on BitMEX–over $164 million worth from traders with long positions. Coincidence? Or is this classic market manipulation at hand? According to certain sources, a whale or group of traders collectively acted to crash the market by putting in a massive sell move of 15,000 ETH on Bitstamp. Chico Crypto states: “The mass sell-off and resulting liquidations was the work of some market manipulations.” You may be wondering what this has to do with Bitcoin or BitMEX. Well, it seems, quite a lot. That order plunged the price immediately from $270 to $190 (otherwise knowns as a “flash crash”).  This has everything to do with BitMEX since it pulls its price data for contracts from just three exchanges–Bitstamp, Kraken and Coinbase Pro. All three of which have way lower liquidity than BitMEX. The ETH dump on Bitstamp represented some $3.5 million of ETH. This made up 15% of its entire trading volume on Sunday–in one trade.  “Like a disease” the flash crash spread to BitMEX ETH futures which bases its contracts’ price 33% on Bitstmap’s price. Contracts were liquidated in the blink of an eye and spread to Bitcoin resulting, according to Chico Crypto, in Sunday’s dump.  It does seem rather strange that BitMEX is the most liquid exchange, yet it calculates its contracts on exchanges with way less liquidity. How come? Market manipulation is not entirely out of the question.  A similar event occurred in May of this year with a Bitcoin flash crash on Bitstamp, which launched an investigation since BitMEX is a major benefactor of such happenings. We already know that BitMEX trades against its customers. This was discovered in April 2018 and the trader was named as ex Deutsche bank trader Nick Andrianov.  While no one is sure who the propagator of this latest flash crash is, a lot of fingers unsurprisingly point to BitMEX. After all, its liquidations, at times, account for up to half of its entire revenue. There were some mixed reactions to the flash crash from the crypto community. Plenty of traders, including Digitex Futures CEO Adam Todd, who has been previously vocal on BitMEX, were quick to point the finger: ShitMEX 💩💩💩 is at it again with market manipulation 📉🧛🏿‍♂️ Meanwhile, #Digitex with its provably fair matching engine, and innovative market maker program WILL PREVENT front-running, queue jumping and give liquidation profits back to its traders 🏆🏆🏆 #Crypto — realAdamTodd (@realAdamTodd) July 17, 2019  However, others were less moved by the news, calling out more BitMEX FUD: Yawn every move n the market is not a conspiracy. It was overbought now it’s looking for the 100dma for support. If you think big players are not going with that flow there’s no hope for you pal ha ha — Timmy Mallet (@tommy_whe) July 16, 2019  Others still, such as highly vocal and vehemently anti cryptocurrency (and BitMEX) economist Nouriel Roubini literally spat venom at Hayes: .@CryptoHayes belongs in jail! LOCK HIM UP! This isn't just prop trading at @BitMEXdotcom . They follow the order flow & they bet against their clients & liquidate them. If is as if in a casino the dealer who sees your cards was allowed to bet against you. Total criminal fraud! https://t.co/TBP1UvONA6 — Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) July 18, 2019  Whether BitMEX was behind the flash crash may not be the most pressing issue. We already know that 95% of cryptocurrency exchange trading volume is fake and market manipulation is par for the course. As Chico Crypto concludes:  “with manipulation going on whether it be BitMEX, Tether, or Bitfinex, it all comes down to centralized exchanges.” This creates a greater case for traders and HODLers alike to keep their own private keys and funds off of unregulated and unscrupulous exchanges. The rising trend for non-custodial accounts and greater transparency may just throw a curveball at the crypto whales. Do you think BitMEX spearheaded the latest Bitcoin price crash?

In a press release issued on July 16, Bitcoin Suisse, which already offers various crypto-focused financial services, also committed to using the Swiss regulatory system for its future expansion.  An application to offer banking services, as well as act as a securities dealer, has gone before the country’s financial regulator, the Swiss Financial Markets Supervision Authority (FINMA). “We took this step to further expand our offering with regulated services and products and thereby strengthening our position as a leading provider of crypto financial services,” staff explained on social media confirming the news. “Bitcoin Suisse is adapting to a changing regulatory landscape, where more and more crypto assets and services fall under securities and banking law,” they added in the release.

Bitcoin Suisse has deposited 45 million Swiss francs ($45.7 million) with a local bank, not named in the release, “as collateral for a default bank guarantee, securing client fiat deposits and pooled crypto deposits.” That figure will shortly rise to 55 million francs ($55.8 million). As Bitcoinist often reports, Switzerland is well known as a lenient jurisdiction for cryptocurrency businesses, and is home to a dedicated lobbying organization, the Crypto Valley Association, headquartered in the town of Zug. Bitcoin Suisse is a member of Crypto Valley, and while executives were previously mulling a move to neighboring Liechtenstein, the latest news put an end to any doubt about its faith in local regulatory direction.  This week also saw comments from Switzerland’s central bank focusing on Facebook’s Libra digital currency offering, which struck a decidedly more laissez-faire tone compared to noises coming from countries such as the US and China. “I think it’s an interesting development and I’m pretty relaxed about it,” Thomas Moser, alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank, said during a dedicated Crypto Valley conference, quoted by Reuters. “They have clearly indicated that they are willing to play according to the rules, they have been contacting the regulators.” Bitcoin Suisse meanwhile is not the only crypto operator locally eyeing a banking license, local media noting that Seba Crypto and Signum are also aiming for FINMA authorization.

Bitcoin’s most recent price action has presented a plethora of challenges to cryptocurrency traders, and the drop below $10,000 has the most bearish traders calling for Bitcoin to revisit the $5,000 – $7,500 range. While theories abound, a popular explanation is fear spun up by Facebook’s Libra hearing with the U.S. Senate Banking Committee combined with bearish technical factors are pushing Bitcoin price lower.  Renowned crypto-analyst FilbFilb recently posted a detailed Twitter thread wherein he makes an argument for why BTC price will not come anywhere near to its previous bottom of $3,120. According to FilbFilb and Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin price will stay above the cost of mining as miners must remain profitable.  …the price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost.”  Essentially, the basic rules of supply and demand will dictate Bitcoin price and in January analysts at JP Morgan Chase found that the extraction cost of mining a single bitcoin averaged $4,060 in Q4, 2018. Comparing this average against the current Bitcoin price shows that miners are still bagging a profit of about $5,500 per Bitcoin.  FilbFilb suggests that miners will sell into market demand whenever the revenue per BTC rises above mining costs but will also “limit selling [as Bitcoin’s] pre-halving event approaches to invoke the new halving bubble”.  FilbFilb elaborated by saying:  What happened in 2018 was miners selling off their Bitcoins at marginal costs. Only the most efficient miners survived, while their inefficient competitors got eliminated.” FilbFilb is of the opinion that miners are now holding on to their newly minted bitcoins in anticipation of the 2020 halving event. If history is a guide, then we should see miners begin to limit sales as they wait for prices to explode on the approach of the halving event, then sell as selling pressure begins to diminish.   Bitcoin’s most recent precipitous drop and FilbFilb’s commentary come after a two day US Senate Banking Committee meeting with Facebook to discuss the intricacies of their Libra project. Bitcoin price could also be influenced by recent comments from US President Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.  Each cautioned the public and regulators about the potential for cryptocurrency to facilitate organized criminal and terrorist activity. Mnuchin even went so far as to label cryptocurrency “a national security threat.” It’s possible that BTC buyers have taken a pause over fears that the Trump administration could levy some sort of partial ban or stringent regulation on the growing crypto sector.  In the long-run, the current pullback is probably nothing more than a mere temporary blip and the majority of BTC investors maintain a bullish view for the sector. One must remember that institutional investors like Fidelity Investments, TD Ameritrade, E*Trade and the Intercontinental Exchange have all openly stated their intentions to provide institutional and eventually retail digital asset services to clients.  Do you think the Bitcoin will reach new lows in 2019?

A few other snippets emerged from the meeting, however, and not all are bad for bitcoin and the crypto industry. The consensus of opinion from senators at yesterday’s hearing was that Facebook is dangerous and any efforts at launching its own digital currency should be highly regulated, if allowed at all. This comes as no surprise considering the company’s recent debacle with data protection and cyber security. The social media giant has yet to demonstrate that it is trustworthy enough to handle global finance and congress hammered that point home. The “Examining Facebook’s Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations” hearing followed one on keeping big tech out of finance, which is clearly the agenda here. Calibra head, David Marcus, was in the hot seat again facing some serious questions, many of which he could not find answers for. Facebook has clearly stirred the hornets’ nest of crypto regulation and many fear a wider clampdown on the fledgling industry. There was a lot of bullish sentiment from the hearing, however, with one senator asserting that you can’t kill bitcoin.

Congressman Warren Davidson may have reignited interest during the hearing with his ‘shitcoin’ comment which was a clear reference to Libra. A lot of people in this space will use a phrase that you may be familiar with: ‘there’s bitcoin, and then there’s shitcoin,’ … All these features are different from many of the things people call colloquially ‘shitcoin’ because the value can be distorted by a central authority, so people do really have their assets at risk. Bitcoin maximalist and president of the Nakamoto Institute, Michael Goldstein, added: “Shitcoin” is not profanity. It is a highly technical term in monetary economics. ""Shitcoin"" is not profanity.

This version is one of the several technological improvements intended to make Bitcoin lightning network transactions cheaper, faster, and safer. Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology offer amazing opportunities for distributed ledgers. However, according to the authors of the paper titled The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments, the blockchain, as a payment tool, by itself, cannot yet handle the volume of the world’s commerce. This might eventually change. Bitcoin developers and engineers are continually making improvements to solve critical issues such as scalability and transaction costs. In effect, technological innovations, such as SegWit, Lightning Network, and Atomic Multi-Path Payments over Lightning, are already helping to solve these issues. Now, Blockstream announces the release of c-lightning version 0.7.1, which brings several technical advances to make the Lightning Network faster and more efficient. In this regard, the most significant improvement is the result of the work that developers Joe Netti and Rusty Russell performed on the gossip protocol. Aware that the Lightning Network is growing exponentially and so far working well, developers Netti and Russel wrote, “However, the burden on hardware is increasing, and if the growth of channels continues to accelerate, the network will be facing scaling issues in the not-too-distant future. Finding an efficient route through a million channels isn’t easy.” We're excited to announce #clightning 0.7.1. This point release includes gossip improvements, longer default invoice timeouts, external-wallet channel funding, more powerful plugin support, better peer error handling, and performance improvements! ⚡️🔌 https://t.co/ir9QCXcWKS pic.twitter.com/7LIncSqmdp — Blockstream (@Blockstream) July 17, 2019  As a result, Netti and Russel, through their “The Million Channel (Lightning) Project,” obtained relevant data that help them to refine the gossip protocol. Thus, with the new deamon gossip, C-lightning transactions can better and more quickly synchronize with peer nodes, while economizing on bandwidth. The Blockstream Engineering Blog states, “The gossip daemon is more selective about which peers it synchronizes its network topology from, considerably cutting down the time to synchronize and the bandwidth consumed by the gossip protocol.” Additionally, the new version allows for longer default timeout invoices. Until now, the default was set to one hour. Now, the timeout for invoices is seven days. Moreover, the new c-lightning version introduces better plugin support, better peer-to-peer handling, and performance improvements. And it facilitates external wallet funding. Presently, three independent teams are working on the Lightning Network implementation: Blockstream, ACINQ, and Lightning Labs. The aim of these projects, among other things, is to minimize transaction costs, while improving the scalability of the Bitcoin network. Blockstream focuses on the c-lightning network. The Lightning Network continues to grow and get adopted at an increasing rate. For example, on July 8, 2019, the Luxembourg-based Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp announced that it had launched a Bitcoin Lightning node “to help grow the network and encourage other companies to get on board.” As of this writing, according to data provided by 1ML, the Lightning Network boasts over 9,075 nodes, with a capacity of about 903 bitcoins.

(UTC),"['Does the Early Bird Get the Worm?', 'Daytrade or Hodl?']","  Eustace Cryptus | Jul 17, 2019 | 17:00 Data analysts at Longhash found that Bitcoin’s price action fluctuates most from midnight to 1 a.m. UTC. Could this present an opportunity for day traders? A recently published report from Longhash found that Bitcoin’s most volatile trading hours occur between midnight and 1 a.m (UTC). The data analytics collective used Crypto Data Download to analyze Coinbase trading data from July 6, 2017, to July 2, 2019. The team observed hourly high and low prices for each hour of each day and then compared this data set to the remaining 23 hours of each day.   The results show that for the past two years, midnight to 1 a.m. UTC has been the time slot where Bitcoin’s price experienced the most volatility. 1 a.m UTC is especially volatile and has a greater number of daily highs and lows than any other hour of each day. It’s possible that 1 a.m UTC is exceptionally volatile as it matches with the start of the evening in North America and beginning of the 8-hour workday in Asia.  It’s fair to say that this is likely one of the times where Western and Asian traders are both actively trading cryptocurrency. The traders in Asia are just waking up and responding to the crypto news of the day, while the red-eyed North American traders are still staring at their keyboards and observing Asian traders reaction to crypto price action.  The chart also shows that there is not a routinely ‘perfect’ time of day to trade Bitcoin and the data set from the last two years suggests that one would have been more likely to buy into a daily low than a high if the purchase was made between 3 a.m. to noon UTC. Longhash cautions that the differences are minuscule and advises that traders not apply the information to their daily trading strategy.   Ultimately, time and Bitcoin’s price action show that time spent invested in the digital assets is much more fruitful than attempting to time the market and purchase on price swings. A quick look at any long-duration chart supports this conclusion.  Do you think its better to day trade or hodl Bitcoin?

However, the indicator is still maintaining the record level in terms of monthly volume. While Bitcoin is heading towards breaking the support level at $9,000, the trading volume is keeping at a decent level. This suggests that bears are strong and the largest coin by market cap hasn’t found its temporary low yet. According to Coinmarketcap historical data, Bitcoin’s trading volume from June 17 to July 16 was 769.8 billion – the largest 30-day figure ever recorded. The daily average for the period was 25.6 billion. For comparison, the daily average volume year-to-date is around 42% lower, at $14.8 billion. The monthly volume figure benefits from the record daily high touched on June 26, at over $45 billion. The lowest daily volume figure was also in June, at over $15 billion. Year-to-date, January has been the worst month in terms of Bitcoin price and trading volume. The latter indicator was at 167.3 billion over the month, with the daily average at $5.4 billion.  Despite the current record level in monthly volume, Bitcoin is a long distance from the traditional forex market, which has an average daily turnover of over $5 trillion as of 2016. Source: https://www.businessinsider.com.au/charts-heres-how-much-currency-is-traded-on-average-every-day-2016-9 It’s worth mentioning that volume data from Coinmarketcap doesn’t include BitMEX, which boasts the highest Bitcoin trading volume. BitMEX allows users to engage in margin trading, meaning that the volume figures are distorted, with the platform’s XBT/USD pair acting more like a derivative product. All in all, BitMEX’s total trading volume in the last 30 days was 207.2 billion, mainly driven by XBT/USD. Interestingly, in the last week, the exchange hass liquidated over $1 billion of long positions against $174.4 million of shorts. Source: https://datamish.com/ This huge long squeeze is likely to be impacting Bitcoin’s current price action, and helping to extend the asset’s losses further. Bitcoin is breaking the recent support levels after US President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have criticized Bitcoin on separate occasions. Also, the US government is concerned with Facebook’s Libra, which adds to the general bearish sentiment of the crypto market. What do you think about the BTC trading volume?

Canadians living in the Toronto suburb of the City of Richmond Hill can now pay their property taxes in Bitcoin thanks to a partnership between the municipality and Coinberry. Coinberry is a Toronto-based crypto-solutions provider and trading platform. Its partnership with the City of Richmond Hill is the second contract the company has inked for processing property taxes. Coinberry’s second client is the Town of Innisfil which is also part of metropolitan Toronto.  On July 10, the city council of Richmond Hill voted to accept Bitcoin as property tax payments, and the option extends to residents as well as businesses in the suburb. When clients make their property tax payments the funds are received by Coinberry and converted into Canadian dollars. This means that the City of Richmond Hill and Innisfil don’t actually hold cryptocurrency for any length of time.  Municipal staff in the City of Richmond Hill estimate that they will be able to accept payments as soon as September 30, but this is dependent upon the amount of time it takes to integrate Coinberry’s technology to existing infrastructure.  Joe di Paola, the deputy mayor of the City of Richmond Hill, said that: We believe that the demand for a digital currency payment option is only going to grow in the coming years, especially amongst millennials. Our Council was aware of Coinberry’s successful implementation of a digital currency payment service with the Town of Innisfil, and since there was no cost and no risk to do the same, it made the decision that much easier for us. Similar partnerships have also been struck in the United States where earlier this year the state of Ohio passed a bill allowing businesses to pay up to 23 various taxes in Bitcoin. The state legislatures in the U.S states of Wyoming and Colorado also have passed legislation which makes it easier for blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses to operate in the state.  Do you think the Bitcoin will eventually be accepted for tax payments worldwide?

With the storm of attention being paid to Facebook’s Libra project, there has been some talk of whether such attention could spill over to BTC in the form of a government-sanctioned bitcoin ban. On Tuesday (July 16, 2019), redditor ‘MarsWalker69’ opened a thread on the Bitcoin subreddit seeking reasons why the U.S. government can ban bitcoin. In response, fellow redditor ‘nowitsalllgone’ provided legal precedence to show why a BTC ban wouldn’t be possible. For starters, there is legal precedent that equates the prohibition of cryptographic communication as akin to an infringement on free speech under the First Amendment. As a computer protocol, Bitcoin represents a mathematical language, which is no different from human languages like English or French, in the eyes of the courts. However, Bitcoin is more than an ordinary computer protocol, in that it allows value transfer across a network. This particular characteristic brings up the financial instrument angle which hostile governments keen on enacting a ban could exploit. In the case of the U.S, going through such a route would also not work. This is because the compensation received from the transfer of information is also protected under freedom of speech — one of the five basic freedoms enshrined in the First Amendment. So, while projects like Libra can have Congressional hearings with the threat of imposing bans, such a scenario appears highly unlikely for bitcoin. Places like China and India provide clear evidence that bitcoin bans are counterproductive to the agenda of the government. The market only goes underground because prohibitions don’t work unless the people are in agreement. Even people in government like Congressman Patrick McHenry understand that a ban would be useless. In an interview with CNBC McHenry declared that there is no capacity to kill bitcoin. Commenting further on the matter, the Congressman from North Carolina said: Even the Chinese with their Firewall and their extreme intervention on their society cannot kill Bitcoin. So, distributed ledger, full and open, in the essence of Bitcoin, as a first mover in the space, the developer of this technology. My point here is, you can’t kill Bitcoin.

The company marks a notable increase in the investment into its products, the majority of which are coming from institutional players.  According to the new Q2 report of Grayscale, the company’s assets under management nearly tripled from $926 million to $2.7 billion. The cause of this is the resurgence of the cryptocurrency market which has had a blast in 2019. Per the report, the quarterly returns for industry benchmark products, namely the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund were 178.8% and 147.6% respectively. Perhaps the most interesting bit of the report is the fact that the highest percentage of total demand for Grayscale’s products came from institutional investors. In the second quarter of 2019, they comprised 84% of the total demand, providing a clear sign that big players are already interested in the field. According to the report, the average weekly investment in all products amounted to $4.9 million. However, $4.1 million of those went into perhaps the most popular product of the company – the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Again, 80% of the investments came from institutions. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) offers shares which are the first publicly quoted securities solely invested in and deriving their value from the price of bitcoin. In other words, they allow institutional investors a chance to gain exposure to the movement in Bitcoin’s price without having to worry about storing, owning, or managing private keys. One share of GBTC represents 0.00097834 BTC, which, at the time of this writing, equals $9.24. The public price of one share, however, is currently $12.61 which is around 36 percent more than its actual BTC value. This means that institutions are happy to pay a 36 percent premium in order to receive exposure to BTC’s price instead of buying Bitcoin directly and having to store and manage it. Grayscale’s latest report further attests to the fact that institutional interest in Bitcoin is soaring in 2019. Back in May, Bitcoinist reported on a Fidelity research which also highlighted the rising interest of institutional investors. What is more, the demand for CME Bitcoin Futures on behalf of big players also soared. In June, it was up 80 percent on a year-over-year basis. What do you think of the rising institutional interest in Bitcoin during 2019? Will it continue or will the sudden pullback diminish it? Don’t hesitate to let us know in the comments below!

This drop has resulted in a clear descending channel forming on intra-minute timeframes. Current market price sits at visible range lows, so the question remains as to whether bears have enough control of the market to break the strong support around $9,000?  On the 30 Minute chart for BTC we can see the newly formed descending channel that price levels have dropped to over the last week. Large selling volume has occurred throughout all stages of the channel with very little response from bullish traders. Key support that will be a crucial level in terms of gauging whether BTC will drop much further or not, is at $8,800. The support line for the channel seems to be very strong which is evident by the numerous re-tests. Right now, Bitcoin price 00 is re-testing support again and will require an extremely large amount of selling pressure to break. Because of this, it’s likely that BTC will experience of a periodic sideways movement around $9,000 support in the short-term. Certain high volume altcoins have begun to surge upwards within the last 24 Hours as BTC continues its descent. The future of altcoins is still very much uncertain and presents a great risk, however, it’s important to monitor the correlation between BTC and altcoins for any potential trade opportunities or indications of future price movements. On the 4 Hour chart, we can clearly see BTC has painted a lower high and a lower low during this pull-back but volume remains high. If price levels bounce around market price and don’t fall below $8,800 the trading range will still be in-tact, and the bullish uptrend mentioned in my previous analysis will likely continue to play out. I’ll be watching closely for a breakthrough the overhead resistance visible on both the 4 Hour analysis and 30 Minute analysis around $9,600. Providing a clear influx of new volume occurs in conjunction with the breakout. price levels will likely move quickly back towards POC (Point of Control) sitting at $11,380. Overall, the general consensus remains bullish until the key support at $8,800 is broken. In my previous analysis, I highlighted all of the key support areas to look out for if $8,800 is broken. Do you think BTC will drop below $8,800 in the coming days or is a short-term reversal on the cards? Please leave your thoughts in the comments below!

Chainlink (LINK)', '2. Holochain (HOT)', '3. Ravencoin (RVN)', '4. Binance Coin (BNB)', '5. Ren (REN)', '6. Enjin Coin (ENJ)']","  Emilio Janus | Jul 17, 2019 | 08:00 In a sample of over 150 top altcoins, only 4% had a positive BTC return over the past year. Other than BNB, none of this 4% were even in the top 100 alts a year ago.  In the sample of 167 leading altcoins chosen by crypto analyst Ceteris Paribus, only 6 performed better than Bitcoin over the past 12 months. The combined BTC market cap of all 167 has dropped by a whopping 69%, from ₿23.4 million to ₿7.2 million. Perhaps more surprisingly, Binance Coin aside, the top performers didn’t even register in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap a year ago. Another similarity is that all of these coins see the majority of their volume traded on the Binance exchange, showing the importance of liquidity. So who were the past year’s big winners?…  If you really wanted to maximise your returns this year you had to be holding Chainlink. Chainlink is a decentralised oracle service to connect smart contracts to data from the outside world. Smart contracts cannot access data outside of their blockchain, so oracles act as a data feed to trigger them from external events (e.g. temperature). But who cares about all that, when LINK token is up 637% in BTC terms over the past year. A year in which bitcoin itself saw an overall 50% gain. However it should be noted that Chainlink is also suffering during bitcoin’s current price correction. Holochain is a decentralised applications (DApp) platform, using peer-to-peer networking to reduce unnecessary synchronisation and increase DApp scalability. It listed on Binance almost a year ago, and is up 97% against bitcoin in the past 12 months. In fact, it was one of Bitcoinist’s top picks to outperform BTC back in November. It’s a far cry from Chainlink’s 637%, but still mightily respectable. Ravencoin is another altcoin that we’ve been keeping an eye on, here at Bitcoinist. The open-source blockchain project allows the creation and peer-to-peer transfer of any real-world or digital assets. Over the past year it is up 91% in BTC terms. So anybody crazy enough to put all of their BTC holdings into RVN tokens a year ago could now exchange them back for almost twice as much bitcoin. Obviously, you would never have done that, but if you did… Binance Coin needs no introduction. It’s march from ‘interesting’ exchange token to serious player has been well documented. The past twelve months have seen it gain 31% against BTC. That may seem like a trifle compared to the top three performers, but compounded with bitcoin’s own 50% overall gain, that’s still a very healthy return. Ren is an open protocol to enable the permissionless and private transfer of value between blockchains. It has seen a 28% increase in BTC value in the past year, making it almost as good an investment as BNB. Enjin coin supports the gaming industry and community. The final token in the sample to outperform BTC, it saw just a 1% gain in comparison. Still, while many are waiting for altseason, it’s good to know that some alts wait for no man. Have you backed any of these top performing alts in your portfolio this year? Let us know in the comment section below!

That was the conclusion in new analysis of an underreported metric this week, which casts light on genuine consumer interest in Bitcoin.  Known as realized market cap, the figure revolves around two values: the price at which each bitcoin last traded, and how many coins were involved in each trade. The resulting figure when multiplying the values gives a fairer representation for cryptocurrencies than traditional market cap, data resource Longhash concluded in the analysis.  For Bitcoin, which now hovers at under $10,000, the realized cap figure is higher than it has ever been – at $93.45 billion.  “What does this mean for Bitcoin? It means that the cost basis for BTC investors is higher than it’s ever been, and that the average purchase price paid by a Bitcoin holder is somewhere in the range of $5,000-$6,000 per coin,” Longhash summarized. In 2019, multiple indicators gave increasingly bullish forecasts for bitcoin’s rebound from the 2018 bear market. This week, however, the mood changed, with analysts now warning that a considerable chunk of this year’s gains could yet evaporate. Realized cap therefore, stands as an increasingly isolated voice in a bearish climate suggesting bitcoin’s underlying health remains intact, despite price woes. “It also helps put 2017 into context,” Longhash continued.  Despite prices rising as high as $19,000, the reality is that almost no trading occurred at those levels. Most investors either held on for the whole bubble, or traded at far lower prices on either side of the peak. BTC trading volumes in fact hit a daily record on several occasions last month, as markets took advantage of a sudden parabolic phase which culminated in BTC/USD reaching $13,800. At the same time, Bitcoin’s dominance in terms of traditional market cap has also reached highs not seen since early 2017.  Recently hitting 67%, the diminishing presence of altcoins sparked several warnings that Bitcoin would retain its presence at other assets’ expense. Veteran trader Peter Brandt referred to the phenomenon as the “Dot Com bubble” for altcoins, while ongoing research continues to support the idea that alt-investors will bare the brunt of the market retraction.  “Most of the damage of decline will occur to altcoins,” Brandt repeated Tuesday as he warned the total cryptocurrency market cap would shed 80% of its parabolic advance.

LedgerX recently revealed the call option and participants are betting that Bitcoin price will top $100k by December 2020. This means Bitcoin would need to pull-off a 10x move from today’s price and this would also bring the digital asset’s market capitalization to $2 trillion.  For the past two years, LedgerX has offered derivatives to its institutional clients and now that the company has gained approval from Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) it will make the unique call option available to retail investors.  Currently, it’s not known how many investors are seriously interested in the product, especially after the serious 25%+ beating Bitcoin has taken over the past two weeks. LedgerX Chief Executive Officer Paul Chou told Bloomberg, “Often what happens is the first trade is the most important, and everybody else watches it.”  Chou also mentioned that many of LedgerX institutional customers with accounts ranging from $10 million to $1 billion have inquired about the call option. According to Chou: “Dozens and dozens of these institutions got back to us saying we’d be interested in trading a contract like this” and Chou explained that while $100,000 is a large sum, “a lot of us who’ve been in this space remember Bitcoin at $1 and then it hit $10 and $100 and $10,000. A $100,000 contract doesn’t even make us blink.” Interestingly, as more and more institutional and derivatives based products debut, Bitcoin has correctly sharply from a double top at $13,200. A number of analysts are saying today’s correction was driven purely by technical while others believe that yesterday’s Senate Banking Committee’s hearing over Facebook’s Libra project has injected an unwarranted amount of fear into the crypto market.  The LedgerX product reveal comes right as other Bitcoin derivatives exchanges like BitMEX and CME are witnessing all-time high volumes as driven by institutional traders.

There is also a video on the campaign page which explains how Tor works and why it should be used to safeguard users on the internet. The advantage of donating in BTC is that there are no rounded up figures and a few satoshis may be all that one can afford.

The increased awareness through media exposure should also help the campaign along. There is clear compassion for this project as raising 65% of the target in the first day has demonstrated.

Uploaded to sharing site Scribd by local blockchain and tech lawyer, Varun Sethi, the document allegedly shows the preliminary text of a new law designed to “prohibit the use of cryptocurrency.” The event adds fuel to existing speculation that India’s government and central bank wish to outlaw the use of cryptocurrencies beyond their control. If the document is genuine, it would confirm that any kind of activity involving bitcoin and altcoins will be illegal. “No person shall mine, generate, hold, sell, deal in, issue, transfer dispose of or use cryptocurrency in the territory of India,” one of the statutes reads. Sethi described the document as “the proposed Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official digital currency bill 2019.”  He noted, The bill is yet to be drafted completely and tabled in the parliament to become an Act with or without modifications Suggested punishments for those who go against the government’s orders include prison sentences of up to ten years.

Since July last year, banks have been prohibited from serving industry businesses such as exchanges, leading to a mass exodus, while others have simply closed down.  In the absence of hard-and-fast laws, some remained hopeful of a positive outcome in the long term, as opponents of the banking ban took the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to court over its decision.  Now, however, India appears set to go even further than China in its anti-crypto stance, while it still remains unclear how authorities would enforce a ban on an entity beyond their control. The issue comes at a poignant time, as the US government itself gets to grips with the realities of decentralized networks.  At a press conference Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stressed a desire to combat cryptocurrencies’ role in illicit activities, while upholding the words of President Donald Trump, who last week described them as “based on thin air.” Unlike the US but similar to China, however, India plans the release of a digital rupee, something the latest document describes as an “official digital currency.” “…The term Cryptocurrency shall not refer to Digital Rupee, or any foreign digital currency recognized as foreign currency in India,” it states.  No specific date has emerged for when any law regulations will become law. As Bitcoinist previously reported, rumors about a crackdown saw predictable reactions from crypto proponents, including the CEO of major exchange Binance.  “The more it is ‘banned,’ the more people want it,” Changpeng Zhao said late last month.

The company plans to refund about $30 million worth of cryptocurrency. On Tuesday, Bitpoint published an update on its website, revealing the amounts of stolen crypto. Also, President Genki Oda held a press conference on the same day, apologizing for the situation. He unveiled that about 50,000 Bitpoint users saw their crypto funds stolen. On Friday, we reported that Bitpoint announced that it had lost 3.5 billion yen worth of cryptocurrency, which is the equivalent of $32 million based on the Friday currency rates. Yesterday, the company said that another $2.3 million worth of crypto missing. The recently discovered missing funds were stolen from exchanges outside Japan, which use Bitpoint’s trading platform. At the press conference, Bitpoint representatives voiced the company’s intention to reimburse affected clients with $30 million worth of crypto. Interestingly, the exchange plans to return the funds specifically in cryptocurrency rather than in fiat equivalents. The exchange confirmed that the breach hit its hot wallets only, while the cold wallets stayed untouched. The platform still maintains its services suspended. Currently, Bitpoint, which is operated by Remixpoint, is collaborating with the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). The latter is a self-regulatory cryptocurrency exchange body launched last year. The JVCEA will help Bitpoint implement customer protection standards. In the latest report, Bitpoint presented the crypto losses by cryptocurrency. According to the exchange, it had lost the following amounts: Thus, Ripple’s XRP accounts for a third of the total loss of 3.02 billion yen. The crypto exchange is reportedly collaborating with the Ripple Foundation as well. What are your thoughts on the Bitpoint hack? Should crypto exchanges ease their dependence on hot wallets?

During this pull-back, another falling wedge has formed visible on all timeframes and could propel price levels back up towards visible range highs over the coming weeks.  On the 4 Hour chart, we can see the two falling wedges that have formed within the same price range as each other. Maxx Momentum indicator also shows similarities as momentum turns red throughout the later stages of the falling wedge towards the breakout. Both the 50MA and 200EMA have been gradually moving closer to each other over the last few weeks showing that the current trading range for BTC is very strong could very well be a period of consolidation before another big move to the upside. Within the last few hours, price action has broken out of the most recent falling wedge as price levels look to retest the breakout point at $10,700.  Both moving averages have also cut through and have broken out of the falling wedge. Volume has remained quite high and also appears to be descending which is an indication of strength around current price levels, as typically descending volume causes price levels to break down out of the trading range. I touched on the current trading range in more depth in my previous analysis here. On the 1 Hour chart, we can now see a close-up image of the recent breakout around $10,700. There’s been no real increase of volume during the breakout, leading me to believe bearish momentum that resulted in the falling wedge being formed has run out of fuel. POC (Point of Control) currently sits around $11,630 which appears to be the next main resistance point for BTC and would be a likely stop if bullish momentum builds up as a result of the breakout. Given two falling wedges which are a notoriously reliable bullish trading pattern have formed during a very strong bullish uptrend on BTC within the same range as each other this is a very strong sign that further upside is the most likely outcome. Many traders are calling for lower lows and for the current trading range to be broken but there’s little to no technical aspects to back this up. BTC dominance is currently a whopping 66% as altcoins continue to dive to lower lows week in, and week out. Providing BTC dominance stays well above that 63% threshold alts will continue to drop further and BTC will likely continue trading at high volume. Do you think the repeating falling wedge patterns on BTC will result in higher highs in the coming weeks? Please leave your thoughts in the comments below!

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer @PhilipHammondUK explains why governments are so worried about Facebook's Libra $FB #btc #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/SYFggQVncw — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) July 15, 2019  When Hammond was questioned as to his ‘take’ on Libra, he was quick to emphasise its potential, both positive and negative. It’s potentially a positive, transformative step, but it also has the potential to deliver great risk into the system. He voiced concerns that if not properly regulated, Libra could become another channel for money laundering, organised crime, and terrorism. So pretty much like every other financial tool out there. Although interestingly, this is an opposite concern of many in the crypto community, who fear a potential lack of privacy in a Facebook run currency. Following Hammond’s comment on money-laundering, the host questioned him as to whether Libra was different to Bitcoin. However, it did not seem that Hammond had particularly been referring to Bitcoin, and he brushed this off this line of questioning by pointing out that it is different because of how it is owned. He quickly moved on to address the UK’s decision to engage with Libra, and work with others to ensure it is effectively regulated. If it works, he claimed, it could be transformative in operating payments systems. The discussion then turned to the recent political backlash against Libra in the US; Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, called for development to be halted; Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, sees Libra as a national security issue; and President Trump has tweeted that Facebook would need to obtain a banking charter. However, Hammond would not be drawn to comment on whether a company issuing an alternative currency would need to be a bank. The UK, he pointed out, like the US, has an independent regulatory system. This issue would then be one for the regulator to decide, not something for politicians to determine. He did stress that anyone operating a systemically important structure, which this could certainly be, should be properly and appropriately regulated. With Hammond’s dismissal of the host’s attempt to associate Bitcoin with money laundering, it seems that the UK position is that Libra is currently a far greater priority in terms of regulation and management. In many ways, this does seem to align with the current US position. What do you make of the UK Chancellor’s views? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!

In its latest edition published July 16, the so-called ‘Crypto Fear and Greed Index’ tracked sentiment swings across the cryptoeconomy over the past week. Compared to any time since the index began in February 2018, the seven days leading up to Tuesday constituted the most volatile ever, leading to new conclusions about the impact of Trump’s words. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index uses several weighted factors to arrive at a value between 0 and 100. The lower the number, the more fear and less greed there are in markets, while higher readings mean markets are driven by greed and are not bearish.  On Tuesday, the number was 34, rated by the index’s creators as mid-level “fear.” Contrast that with the previous day, however, and the volatility becomes immediately apparent: on Monday, the number was just 16, rated as “extreme fear.” Just one week ago, when Bitcoin traded above $13,000, ratings were hitting the low 80s, something the index characterized as “extreme greed.”  The sudden change was unlike anything charted by the index at any point, with only two analogues: last November’s sudden price plunge and initial optimism earlier in 2018.   “The crypto market behaviour is very emotional,” creators explain.  “People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers.” As Bitcoinist reported, Trump initially had little impact on Bitcoin markets after releasing several tweets stating his opposition to cryptocurrency in general. Volatility then kicked in, with BTC/USD undergoing a 17% correction in recent days before bouncing off lows around $9900.  With the declines, however, came a rapid change of sentiment, according to the index, leading to a possible conclusion that Trump in fact flushed out opportunistic traders and, perhaps ironically, helped the market to mature. Crypto Fear and Greed is meanwhile not the only index charting Bitcoin’s progress which has left an impression in recent times.  As Bitcoinist noted, Trace Mayer’s ‘Mayer Multiple’ delivered a positive outlook when BTC/USD traded at similar levels in June, forecasting an end-of-year price point around $21,000. This, it said, would be “fair value” for the largest cryptocurrency.  At press time, the Multiple had dropped to 1.8 from its June reading of 2.09. Any reading below 2.4, according to Mayer, represents a good opportunity for accumulating Bitcoin. What do you think about the changes in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index?

The 53-minute long discussion ventured into uncomfortable territories of both the bitcoin and mainstream finance. While Roubini kept his focus on the criminal nature of cryptocurrencies and their evangelists, Hayes projected them as a means to promote financial privacy.  Roubini opened with a monologue about the “sh***y behavior” of the cryptocurrency industry as he spilled insults over Hayes for running an unregulated cryptocurrency exchange that offers highly risky leverage services. The economist compared BitMEX with businesses that cash on the stupidity of non-accredited, inexperienced investors. He added that BitMEX is an unregulated cryptocurrency exchange that offers highly risky leverage services. They do not offer 5 times leverage, they don’t offer 10 times either. But they offer 100 times, so even a 0.5 percent move in the price could wipe investors out of their positions,” Roubini told Hayes. “Your business model is all what the cryptocurrency industry is all about: no regulation, no KYC, no audits. You can screw clients financially and it doesn’t matter. A defensive Hayes admitted that BitMEx offers highly risky leverage services to clients but felt the practice was way too frequent even for a US-regulated entity. The CEO added that their exchange only pitted traders against each other while serving as a custodian to their assets as they go on trading. I’m not trying to force anyone to use BitMEX. We don’t even do any marketing… Somehow, a few hundred thousand people who have found other oasis and started trading. We are not making people trade bitcoin. No one said you have to go out and own it. And then send it to us and use it as margins. Winner: Roubini There is a reason why regulators allow only people with specific income slabs to become accredited investors. Some investments are highly risky and purely speculative. They could easily rip small investors off their savings, which is why investments like bitcoin are dangerous. That is what Roubini told Hayes while explaining the ill-effects of exchanges like BitMEX, which to date remains outside the purview of the US regulators since it works from a so-called lightly-regulated Seychelles. Roubini said, Now what happens with these unregulated exchange is that anybody can go to them, put leverage 100 times, and lose their entire financial wealth He also claimed that he knows many individuals, including students, personally who lost their life savings and loan money after purchasing bitcoin during the 2017 bull run. They all have been royally screwed Hayes did not respond to how everyday investor lost money while betting on bitcoin. Nevertheless, the BitMEX CEO assured that working with Seychelles regulators is as okay as working with any other regulator in the world. Responding to Roubini, Hayes said New York is not the frontrunner of financial regulations. Hayes added,  Just because the US does something does not mean that everybody else needs to follow Winner: Hayes A large part of the discussion witnessed Roubini and Hayes locking horns over the necessity of digital assets like cryptocurrencies. Hayes adamantly projected bitcoin as a tool that promises financial independence and more privacy. The BitMEX CEO discussed a hypothetical case wherein an activist – not liked by his government – gets his bank accounts and funds confiscated. If such a thing happens, then bitcoin offers a way to circumvent those bans. That has happened even during the Hong Kong protests… In a centralized system, we want convenience. A decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain system is not going to be as fast as systems like Alipay. However, it has a different use case. Privacy is expensive. And if you value it, you’ll have to pay for it. The remarks followed Roubini’s attack on bitcoin’s scalability, wherein the economist criticized the cryptocurrency for processing merely five transactions per second. In comparison, payment processing companies like Visa processed 25,000 transactions per second. Roubini stated that even developing nations did not need to use bitcoin for payments since they already have cheaper, non-volatile payment alternatives. Hayes defended bitcoin against scalability issues, stating that the cryptocurrency is only a decade old and has room to improve. He added that bitcoin could be much faster but people looking for privacy would still not use it for making payments. The conversation later switched to private keys, a method using which a bitcoin owner retains 100 percent ownership of his holdings. Hayes projected the technology as a tool for people to be in 100 percent control of their money. At the same time, Roubini believed the solution is taking the financial systems back to the stone age where people hid their gold under the ground. The cryptocurrency system is totally not secure… If somebody steals my credit card or bank information, then it takes me 30 seconds to call my bank and recover my funds. Adding that bitcoin private keys lacked such “deposit insurance,” Roubini explained anybody can those “piece of papers” at gunpoint. Therefore, people can lose millions and billions of dollars in a puff, without any insurance to recover them back. It is equivalent to the times when people secured money under their mattresses. It’s like having a big cave underground where you have to keep your bitcoins. And then, you have to write down private key on a piece of paper. Then you have to hide it somewhere, in the walls or mattresses and wonder whether or not the rats are going to eat it up. Winner: Tie Watching both Hayes and Roubini trying to grab each others’ throats was like watching a TV soap opera. Each side began with a promise of making knowledgeable points but, at the apex of it, it turned the debate into a curse-fest. Roubini remained an unapologetic basher who enjoyed insulting with his stern face, and even though his points about the bitcoin’s scalability, regulations, and security landed well, his Rambo avatar in the end washed down the efforts. As of Hayes, the BitMEX CEO smiled and laughed through the debate, always bringing himself to discussing privacy and people’s right to non-sovereign assets. He could have discussed Lightning Network in response to Roubini’s remarks on bitcoin speed. There were also opportunities to project bitcoin as a solution against the so-called banking cartels, inflation, and whatnot – as a fellow evangelist Andreas Antonopolous would have done. But Hayes didn’t. Overall, it was a very poor debate. It didn’t address the heart of the problem: how to organize the money creation and regulatory institutions. Nevertheless, even a poor one has a winner in the end. Who do you think won the ‘Tangle in Taipei Crypto Spat’?

The asset itself reacted strongly with a 6% pump on the day and many have taken the positives from the speech, some claiming that it is ‘wildly bullish’. The rhetoric was to be expected, politicians and bankers still see bitcoin as a tool to do bad things. In reality, it is no different to cash or any other commodity that can be transferred beyond the gaze of prying eyes. The vast majority of crypto users are not criminals, drug traffickers or money launderers, yet the whole space keeps getting this deleterious label because bureaucrats don’t understand it and consequently fear it. A number of industry observers have taken the positives out of Mnuchin’s commentary which echoed the words in president Trump’s recent crypto tweet. Ikigai Asset Chief Investment Officer, Travis Kling, noted that both the Treasury Secretary and the Fed Chairman agree on bitcoin’s status as a store of value. The Chairman of the Fed and the Treasury Security both agree that Bitcoin is a speculative store of value. Both of them, along with the President, agree that Libra and Bitcoin are two very different things. Wildly bullish.

It appears that the US Treasury is more concerned over Facebook’s ambitions to dominate digital finance as it has done with data. Mnuchin stated: “With respect to Facebook’s Libra and other developments in cryptocurrencies, our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse.” A mammoth data farm and internet monopoly with over 2 billion users effectively starting its own bank is bound to rustle a few feathers. If anything, Facebook’s insatiability has shed a better light on bitcoin as nobody owns or controls it, making it the total antithesis of Libra. Was the recent speech bullish for bitcoin?

The cryptocurrency market turned bearish as Mnuchin mentioned the negative aspects of digital assets. His speech focused on Bitcoin and Facebook’s Libra. Specifically, the secretary said during a Monday press conference that Libra could be misused for criminal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing. Mnuchin noted, Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs and human trafficking. Many players have attempted to use cryptocurrencies to fund their malign behavior He even said that cryptocurrencies were a national security issue and that he wasn’t comfortable today with the launch of Libra.  Mnuchin’s comments come several days after President Donald Trump himself revealed in a tweet that he was not a fan of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. His reaction accelerated the market correction, with Bitcoin losing about 10% in the weekend. I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019  Mnuchin defended his boss, saying that Trump had legitimate concerns. The Treasury Secretary is worried that Libra would fuel illicit activities. The social media giant announced the Libra project last month, sparking intense reactions from politicians and regulators across the globe. Facebook has scheduled a hearing before the US Senate Banking Committee for Tuesday, July 15. The next day, the social media company faces another hearing before the House Financial Services Committee. While it’s difficult to anticipate an outcome of the Libra saga, we see that the pressure is growing from both Republicans and Democrats. Last week, Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, told lawmakers that he would like Facebook to halt the launch of Libra, which is planned for next year. Facebook commented on the situation, telling CNBC that it had expected a critical response from regulators, central banks, and lawmakers around the world. Nevertheless, Libra was announced a year ahead because of this exact reason – to address those concerns. At this point, Mnuchin regards Libra as a national security issue indeed. He said: With respect to Facebook’s Libra and other developments in cryptocurrencies, our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse. We will not allow digital asset service providers to operate in the shadows. All in all, the predominant words used by Mnuchin in his speech were negative, with terms like illicit, terrorism financing, money laundering, highly volatile, speculative nature, and fraud being often used repeatedly. Mnuchin’s stance already sparked critical comments on Twitter and other social media channels. What is your take on it?

Timothy Peterson, the author of Metcalfe’s Law as a Model for Bitcoin’s Value, recently tweeted a chart comparing the MSCI Japan in USD to Bitcoin in JPY from July 2014 until July 2019. According to Peterson, “Either traders think $BTC is some sort of 10x leveraged Japanese tech stock, or Japan has significant exposure to Bitcoin.”   The chart shows the correlation between the MSCI ETF and the BTC-Yen pairing and it tightens to nearly lockstep pace starting in April 2016. Correlation between Bitcoin and other markets has long been a hot topic of discussion and analysts have continuously debated whether an inverse or direct correlation is best for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Peterson is of the opinion that the correlation is not positive and he explained that:  The implications of this are not good btw. You can’t sell BTC’s diversification benefits to institutions if it doesn’t actually diversify. If traders treat BTC like a stock and the market crashed, BTC will crash HARD. Bitcoin trading is extremely popular in Japan and one prevailing theory is that in addition to an uptick in Japanese traders, people edged out of the market by China’s Bitcoin ban have taken their funds to exchanges headquartered in Japan and Singapore instead. Furthermore, previous estimates show that in 2016 Japanese Yen was used to purchase nearly 42% off all the Bitcoin traded in 2016.   Twitter respondents reacted with mixed reactions to Peterson’s tweet and one follower agreed that 2017 – 2018 witnessed a huge amount of Bitcoins changing hands. @Captain_Reason also speculated that the Bank of Japan is frequently printing money and buying assets which could possibly include Bitcoin.  While the proposal is a bit of a stretch it’s certainly a possibility, and in 2018 handfuls of Wall Street institutional investors who previously scoffed at Bitcoin revealed that they had been investing in the digital asset and developing investment instruments for institutional clients.   Interestingly, Japan has a disproportionately high number of crypto exchange hacks but in spite of this, traders continue to invest significant sums into the crypto market. Most recently, Bitpoint crypto exchange was hacked for $32 million and Japan’s Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is reported to be cracking down on exchanges with poor security protocols.  The Nikkei Asian Review recently reported that the FATF is directing the Financial Services Agency (FSA) to exert pressure on cryptocurrency exchanges that offer KYC-free and anonymous transactions. It’s possible that as exchanges are forced to implement stringent KYC and AML processes Bitcoin trading volume could drop and perhaps the correlation between BTC and the MSCI could weaken.  Do you think Bitcoin correlation to traditional markets is good or bad?

Kuwait', '2. Venezuela', '3. Myanmar', '4. Bahrain', '5. China']","  Christina Comben | Jul 15, 2019 | 14:00 If you’re thinking about dusting off your ASIC now that BTC price has recovered, you may want to pack your bags as well. Check out the top five cheapest countries to mine Bitcoin below.  Mining Bitcoin can be a profitable business if you live in a handful of countries. But the electricity cost can quickly outstrip your earnings if power is expensive in your area.  According to Powercompare.uk, Bitcoin mining now consumes more electricity than 178 other countries worldwide. That includes most countries in Africa, as well as Greece and Ireland–pretty big business you could say.  So where are the cheapest places to mine Bitcoin? Let’s take a look.  With a relatively low cost of living all around, Kuwait City comes in at 148th most expensive worldwide. There’s no shortage of sunshine in this Arabic country and apparently, there’s also no shortage of cheap electricity. Mining one Bitcoin costs just $1,415 in this middle eastern terrain.  If you can battle your way through the food shortages, hyperinflation, and power-outages, Venezuela is still the second cheapest place to mine Bitcoin at just $1,630 per BTC. With Venezuelan consumption of Bitcoin rising all the time, perhaps it’s unsurprising that BTC mining is so prolific here.  If you’re feeling the call of the exotic, why not head out far east to Myanmar where mining one Bitcoin will set you back around $3,087? Maybe not so appealing during last year’s bear market. But with Bitcoin consistently over $10k, that’s still a pretty nice return. And you’ve got plenty of temples to look at. Cheaper than neighboring Kuwait, Bahrain’s capital city of Manama could be a decent place to relocate if you want to mine Bitcoin. At around $3,628 per Bitcoin, you can make a handsome profit.  Although it should be noted, you’ll also have to crank up the a/c in all the countries listed above so your equipment doesn’t overheat in the scortching summer temperatures.  The legality of Bitcoin mining in China may be somewhat uncertain with its National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) calling for the industry to be “eliminated.”  However, there is still not an outright ban on BTC mining.

Any financial market that relies partially or integrally on speculators is vulnerable to the psychological factor. Traders are often exaggerating the driving force of a particular news or event. This is what causes the fear of missing out (FOMO) or the fear of losing it all. In the old days of stock exchanges that had physical locations, speculators often overreacted on verbal or newspaper rumors. This funny cartoon published on The Economist is quite representative:  In modern times, the fake news resides on the Internet. The latter has inspired hope for more transparency and less manipulation, as opposed to the TV content. However, the cryptocurrency market demonstrates that rumors can spread much faster online, and have a global reach. According to a recent study by Pew Research Center, about 60% of US adults who read news via social media admitted that they had shared false information. The percentage drops to 51% when it comes to conventional media like TV and newspapers.  The problem with social media is that it can magnify the effect of any public event or news in a distorted manner, even when it’s genuine. This is why social media giants like Facebook and Twitter started a war against fake news. Fake news is everywhere, given that social media is at the epicenter of the crypto industry. Scammers regard it as a great tool. We have probably seen hundreds of pump and dump schemes in which whales spread misinformation online to profit at the expense of naive investors. Things become more worrying when fake news cause bigger scandals. Last week, we reported how Tron was a victim of fake news. Twitter user @haydenotto_ shared footage showing how Chinese officers “where raiding Tron’s headquarters,” hinting that the crypto project was a scam. Police raids at #Tron offices in Beijing? Additionally, there's many angry people gathered there who are saying things like ""Tron is a scam"". $trx #trx @justinsuntron pic.twitter.com/qFykQErQu6 — Hayden Otto (@haydenotto_) July 8, 2019  Tron CEO Justin Sun clarified the situation, saying that it was about a ponzi scheme that claimed association with the project. Sun considers fake news to have a big impact indeed. He even believes that US President Donald Trump is misled by fake news when he says that Bitcoin isn’t money. Mr. President, you are misled by fake news. #Bitcoin & #Blockchain happens to be the best chance for US! I'd love to invite you to have lunch with crypto leaders along with @WarrenBuffett on July 25. I guarantee you after this lunch, nobody will know crypto more than you! https://t.co/ZpRFEbninv — Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) July 12, 2019  Fake news is a terrible phenomenon, but social media companies inadequately obsessed with it might end up imposing a form of censorship. Thus, it is our duty to avoid confusing the free speech with misinformation. While the crypto market evolves, it’s imperative to protect your investment decisions from the impact fake news by doing your due diligence. Have you ever been a victim to online misinformation? If yes, how did it affect your investment decisions? Share your experience in the comments section! ","['fake news', 'Pump and Dump', 'Social Media', 'tron']"

Tweeting on Monday (July 15, 2019), TokenAnalyst revealed that on-chain inflows for major bitcoin exchanges have been much lower than outflows in the last 24 hours. This trend indicates panic selling as the bitcoin price looks likely to fall below $10,000. 🚨 24H BTC exchange on-chain flows:#binance: $85M in | $97M out#bitstamp: $69M in | $159M out#bittrex: $4M in | $6M out#poloniex: $6M in | $4M out#bitmex: $26M in | $24M out See more at https://t.co/6AFFM1D63p — TokenAnalyst (@thetokenanalyst) July 15, 2019  Bitcoin is down more than 20% in the last five days since crossing $13k last Wednesday (July 10, 2019). That particular move above $13,000 was the second such occurrence in 2019. These outflows may be a minor shakeout of weak hands who might have been hopeful for a sustained run beyond $13,000. With the bitcoin price hovering above the $10,300 support level, there is a concern that the top-ranked crypto might lose ground on the gains accrued since June. According to TokenAnalyst, Bitstamp has seen the largest BTC outflow. As at press time, total withdrawals over the last 24 hours stands at $159 million against just $69 million in deposits. Other leading crypto exchanges, including Binance and Bittrex have also reported disproportionately higher withdrawal amounts than deposits as their customers exit the volatile market in droves.  The previous price march above $13,000 in late June saw a decline that bottomed out at $9,800. At the time, $11.5k proved to be resistance level for bitcoin. Back in late June, Bitcoinist reported that bitcoin was likely to be overbought by July 13 based on Alex Krüger’s analysis. The Economist and crypto analyst also predicted that BTC will likely fall below $10,000 as a result. Over the last five days, there has been a growing narrative of BTC likely falling to the $8,000 price level. Bitcoin hasn’t traded at $8,000 since mid-July 2019. A fall to the $8k level effectively nullifies all the gains accrued since the middle of June. Such a price drop is also in keeping with the mid-summer price blues for bitcoin. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, the latter half of summer often sees the worst monthly performance for BTC. BTC analyst. Josh Rager. revealed that high selling pressure at BTC’s current price could see a drop to $8,000. There is also a CME BTC futures gap at $8,500 that is yet unfilled. However, given the overarching bullish narrative which still persists, any pullback will only be a precursor to another upward price march in the long-term. Do you think the bitcoin price will slide to $8,000 during this price reversal? Let us know in the comments below.

Data from monitoring resource Coin Dance, which tracks trading across three decentralized P2P platforms, confirmed the new all-time high record this weekend. For the last seven days ending July 13, Venezuelan Localbitcoins users traded 49.24 billion sovereign bolivars (VES). That was more in VES terms than in any week since records began.  In Bitcoin terms, trading did not produce records; the 49 billion VES equated to just 512 BTC, Coin Dance suggests, underscoring the economic fragility still omnipresent in the country.  Nevertheless, neighboring countries saw upticks in trading themselves, despite the impact of US president Donald Trump saying he did not believe in or appreciate Bitcoin’s value. Chile recorded 194 million pesos’ worth of transactions on Localbitcoins last week, around 50 million off its all-time high.  In Colombia, the figure was 9.1 billion Colombian pesos, just 1.5 billion off its best weekly performance which occurred in the first week of May.  Brazil reported different interesting numbers. According to local exchange bitValor, June saw a 23% surge in the number of BTC trades against the Brazilian real in total, with volume passing 1 billion BRL. “Despite the increase, the monthly closing was 15% below the daily maximum of the BRXBT Index in the month of June,” executives wrote in a summary. This instability and strong oscillation of the BRXBT index should continue during July as the market tests new levels of Bitcoin’s quotation. In recent days, BTC/USD has declined sharply, hitting as low as $9912 compared with over $13,000 just six days ago. The most recent data shows $27 billion changing hands on official exchanges worldwide.  Within P2P, Bisq, a decentralized platform tracked by Coin Dance, produced multiple new records of its own for different jurisdictions in recent weeks.  The success coincided with Localbitcoins withdrawing the option to arrange cash meetings for bitcoins, a decision which users met with considerable scorn when it came into effect at the start of June. At the time, Bitcoinist produced a list of alternatives for those wishing to maintain the same level of privacy offered by cash meet-ups.  What do you think about South America’s Bitcoin trading?

As if it wasn’t already bad enough to have had $32 million of cryptocurrency stolen by hackers, Bitpoint has just disclosed that an additional $2.3 million has also gone missing. The new funds were discovered missing from exchanges based outside of Japan, but which use Bitpoint’s trading system. As Bitcoinist reported on Friday, the Japanese exchange reported that hackers had stolen cryptocurrency worth 3.5 billion yen ($32 million). Of this, $22.7 million were client funds, whilst the rest was from its own reserves. The cryptocurrency exchange operator suspended all transactions and services following Fridays hack, and has yet to resume operations. In what could be considered a slight silver lining, Bitpoint announced yesterday that the value of the initial hack was now estimated at 3.05 billion yen. However, it is not clear whether this is due to a reassessment of which funds are missing, or simply because of the overall drop in cryptocurrency prices over the weekend. Bitpoint Japan’s hot wallet system, which was the target of the attack, holds Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ripple (XRP). All of these have dropped in price since Friday’s hack. As mentioned following the initial hack, a full third of crypto frauds and hacks have occurred in Japan. These account for a massive $920 million of the $2.7 billion stolen worldwide over the past eight years by cyber attackers. And that is before taking the Bitpoint hack into account!  The Japanese Financial Services Authority (FSA) has an inspection from FATF (Financial Action Task Force) coming up. Following its last dismal performance in 2008, it is desperate to impress. After the 2018 hack of CoinCheck it strengthened guidelines, but stated that it did not intend to excessively regulate. However, it will be interesting to see if this latest incident along with the impending inspection forces the FSA into remedial action. What do you make of these latest findings?

The selloff accelerated on Sunday and has shown no signs of abating during Monday morning’s Asian trading session. Since bitcoin dropped below $11k yesterday, it has not looked back as there have been no retests of this level.

The 200 day MA is back at $6,000 which is a long way down from here, most analysts agree that solid support lies above $8,000 so that could be the next target if the bears keep up the pressure. Around $35 billion has been dumped from crypto markets since the same time yesterday. Total market cap is now at $275 billion, which has wiped out all gains made over the past month. As usual, it is the altcoins that are suffering greater pain as they still remain hopelessly coupled to the movements of their big brother. Ethereum has been absolutely axed, dumping almost 20% in a fall back to $220. Ripple’s XRP has not suffered as badly this time around, losing only 6% on the day in a drop to $0.31 but Litecoin’s gains are being heavily eroded as halving is forgotten and LTC slides below $90.

Where do we go from here? On Sunday bears launched a coordinated assault on Bitcoin price which resulted in the price dropping below $10,000 for the first time since July 2. By the weekly close, the king of cryptocurrencies had dropped $1,400 and the total crypto-market cap dipped below $300 billion. As the carnage occurred, the illustrious John McAfee took to Twitter and lambasted investors who were running for the hills forecasting doom for Bitcoin.     McAfee scolded investors for freaking out over weekly fluctuations and reminded investors to recall Bitcoin price’s parabolic move over the past few months.  Despite today’s $1,400 correction, McAfee remains confident that Bitcoin price will reach his $1 million projection by the end of 2020 and he isn’t the only crypto influencer not bothered by today’s correction.   Popular crypto-analyst PlanB tweeted an intriguing stock to flow analysis which shows BTC price reaching $100K a little after the 2020 halving event, followed by $1 million by 2024 and $10 million by 2028.  On July 12 Tuur Demeester also posted a chart outlining Bitcoin’s seasonal price performance since 2011 and eagle-eyed traders will probably glean useful tidbits that will help provide foresight into Bitcoin’s future price action.   While today’s drop from $11,400 to below $9,800 is terrifying, corrections of this type are normal for Bitcoin. Investors with a long vision of Bitcoin realize that sharp pullbacks tend to follow parabolic advances and the current correction is likely an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin.  As one would expect, the rest of the top-10 cryptocurrencies took on heavy losses as Bitcoin crashed. Ethereum dropped as low as $191, while Litecoin, EOS, and XRP also took on heavy losses ranging from 15 to 20 percent.  Overall, the crypto market dropped more than $20.1 billion over the last 24-hours. It’s likely that analysts will spend the next few days attempting to determine if the drop was primarily based on technicals or whether larger hands were at play.  Do you think Bitcoin price will quickly recover to $12,000?

Thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump, Bitcoin is now officially a 2020 election issue. Earlier this week Trump responded to U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s comments that Bitcoin is a speculative store of value similar to gold and this simple tweet could have catapulted Bitcoin into the lexicon of the 2020 presidential campaign.   Interestingly, Bitcoin price pumped a little after Trump’s tweet and it appears that investors believe Trump’s short-term focus on the cryptocurrency will translate to positive gains in Bitcoin price.  Executives from the world of finance also believe Trump’s tweet could bode well for cryptocurrency over the long run and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted that this is “possibly the largest bull signal for [Bitcon] ever.  Wall Street veteran and Blockchain Task Force member Caitlin Long also urged President Trump to bring blockchain and cryptocurrency experts onboard as part of a blockchain summit as she suspects that the president is being misadvised by his administration on the real capacity of blockchain and cryptocurrency.    Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Tron founder Justin Sun also chimed in and urged President Trump to reassess his perception of Bitcoin and Armstrong excitedly tweeted: Achievement unlocked…First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. We just made it to step 3 y’all.”  Meanwhile, eToro senior market analyst Mati Greenspan said, “Even though Donald says he’s not a fan of Bitcoin, the fact that he’s mentioning it at all is hugely bullish for the entire crypto market.” The great thing about Trump’s Bitcoin mention is that now other presidential candidates can respond with their cryptocurrency opinions. Take, for example, Democratic candidate Andrew Yang, who previously said:  The blockchain has a wealth of potential. [It] could make many things more secure, transparent, and efficient.”  Yang, who is primarily known for his universal basic income (UBI) plan that would distribute a $1,000 monthly payment to every American, also accepts campaign donations in Ethereum, Bitcoin and other digital assets.  Given that there are 22 candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, it’s possible that the Bitcoin question will surface during the upcoming Democratic debates. As P.T. Barnum famously said many years ago, “There’s no such thing as bad publicity” and history has shown that Bitcoin thrives off press regardless of it being positive or negative.  Do you think Bitcoin will be an issue that 2020 presidential candidates will have to discuss?

Will HODL’ers be able to hold their nerves at this critical time, or will panic selling force BTC out of the pennant? Let’s take a look.  Over the last 24hrs, ramped up selling has sent Bitcoin tumbling by a further $890 (-7.77%) – leaving the largest cryptocurrency by market capital fighting to stay above water around the $10,700 level. Looking at the 4-Hour BTC/USD chart, we can see that the asset has recently picked up along the uptrending support of the bullish pennant that is has been tracking inside of for the past 3 weeks. This particular level overlaps with the 0.5 fibonacci level as well as the weekly close zone, and represents a critical area for BTC buyers to defend. This ‘make or break’ moment creates a lot of fear and uncertainty, and particularly affects less experienced traders who are more easily scared out of the market. In an attempt to shake out weak hands at this key level, BTC whales have upped their offensive over the last 8 hours with selling volume showing a marked increase on the MACD histogram. Their plan here is to trigger stop losses and force emotional traders to sell their positions so that they can scoop up cheaper BTC before initiating a new uptrend. Dead cat bounces and fakeouts are the common terms for this type of strategy. What we usually expect to see from this type of strategy is a strong bearish breakout through the support which quickly snaps back above the level before the close, leaving a long wick beneath the candle. Novice traders who fell for the fakeout, are usually forced to buy back in at a higher price once whale traders initiate a new uptrend. Over a closer time period we can see that Bitcoin price 00 is also tracking inside a small falling wedge, which appears to reach maximum consolidation around the $10,400 level. Falling wedges are typically bullish reversal patterns, and supports the idea that Bitcoin will begin a new uptrend soon once the weak hands are shaken out. On the MACD and RSI indicators we can see that short-term momentum seems to be improving, with selling volume decreasing on the MACD histogram and the RSI recovering out of the oversold region. Increased volume can also be seen as BTC bulls attempt to relaunch from the downtrending support. What do you make of the Whale traders strategy?

So another week must be another seven dollars? Which seems like a bit of a bargain. Well you can get your round up of all the weeks Bitcoin news for even less than that, as we’re giving it away for free.  Whilst some may be disappointed that BTC price is finishing the week pretty much where it started, another week of consolidation is certainly not a bad thing. A bearish weekly close last week saw some forecasting a temporary drop back to four figures, spurring a buying frenzy. However the drop didn’t materialise and the price actually started to pump instead; gaining 11% and pushing it back towards £13k. The breakout by the bulls was seen as a significant move, prompting bold price predictions  both for this cycle, and the next few years. Some felt that new all-time highs were imminent, with little resistance as BTC broke $13,000 once more. The US Federal Reserve finally conceded that Bitcoin is a store of value like gold, and that US Dollar hegemony should not be relied on indefinitely. Unsurprisingly, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, took umbrage at this tweeting that the Dollar rules and Bitcoin’s for fools (but less eloquently). Many saw Trump’s interjection as a bullish sign for Bitcoin, but while Google searches went up, the price dropped. Admittedly, this was more to do with a second rejection in the $13,000s, than the tweet. Following this, Bitcoin price continued in a roughly sideways trajectory to close out the week in the $11k region that it started in. However, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee believes it will be third time lucky next time BTC price tries to break $13,400. Facebook’s Libra ‘cryptocurrency’ has been in the news again, as the company claimed it will not link personal data to transaction information, in a letter to US senators. However, the veracity of this statement was questioned, as certain aspects were addressed in a rather vague manner. Libra also got a specific mention in Trump’s anti-crypto Twitter tirade, but that didn’t seem to put off the Winklevoss twins, who are allegedly willing to bury the hatchet and cough up the $10 million to join the Libra organisation. Police raided Tron‘s Beijing offices over claims it turned a blind eye to a $30 million ponzi scheme. Following a ‘will-they won’t-they ban it’ saga which puts even the Russians to shame, there was no mention of Bitcoin in India’s Union Budget. Some interpreted this as a positive sign, although at this stage in the game, nothing is certain. $8 million worth of Bitcoin stolen in the Binance hack were on the move this week. A Polish crypto exchange ceased trading earlier in the week and locked away $16 million of its customers money. Tether hit the headlines again as the New York Attorney General continued to push allegations against it and Bitfinex. A major Australian supermarket chain has started accepting payments in Bitcoin. And Weiss ratings has finally given Bitcoin an ‘A’ rating… which is nice. Have you ever wondered what the Bitcoin blockchain looks like in 3D? Nope, me neither.

Even with bitcoin’s almost 14% pullback from the recent high of $13k, its market dominance still remains a solid 67.7% at the moment according to Tradingview. Around $10 billion has been lost from total market capitalization over the past 24 hours, which now stands at $307 billion. The scene is completely red this morning as most of the top 10 crypto assets continue to slide. Taking the biggest dump today is Bitcoin SV losing over 7%, and falling below $150. A vast majority of altcoins are in meltdown mode today, apart from South Korean blockchain project, ICON (ICX). The ICX token has surged 46% in the last 24hrs as VELIC, the first exchange on the ICON ecosystem, launches. Will bitcoin correct back to $8k? Add your thoughts below.

Wells Fargo’s decision diverges from other leading financial institutions, who are becoming increasingly pro-crypto technology. For example, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman believes in the value of cryptocurrencies and predicts that Bitcoin could be the “global currency of the future.” The CME Group saw Bitcoin promise when it started exchanging Bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017. On the other hand, after bashing Bitcoin for years, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon made a U-turn by regretting having called the cryptocurrency a fraud, and now JPMorgan Chase is getting ready to release its own cryptocurrency. Most recently, during his second day of testimony in the U.S. Senate, Jerome Powell’s testimony legitimized Bitcoin as a store of value. In contrast, Wells Fargo is turning in the opposite direction. Specifically, Wells Fargo displays its anti-Bitcoin stance by not allowing its customers to perform transactions involving cryptocurrencies, as the tweet below shows, Thanks for reaching out to us. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo does not allow transactions involving cryptocurrency. -Josh — Ask Wells Fargo (@Ask_WellsFargo) July 12, 2019  This prohibition is contrary to Wells Fargo’s vision, which states, “Customers can be better served when they have a relationship with a trusted provider that knows them well, provides reliable guidance, and can serve their full range of financial needs.” However, by forbidding a customer from performing transactions in Bitcoin, Wells Fargo is not serving its customers’ “full range of financial needs.” In June 2018, Wells Fargo banned the purchase of Bitcoin and other crypto-assets using Wells Fargo credit cards. When the ban was announced, a company spokesperson stated, “Customers can no longer use their Wells Fargo credit cards to purchase cryptocurrency […] We’re doing this in order to be consistent across the Wells Fargo enterprise due to the multiple risks associated with this volatile investment. This decision is in line with the overall industry.” When Wells Fargo claims that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are risky and volatile, it may be forgetting its prominent and infamous role during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, when markets collapsed. As a result, millions lost their homes, and millions lost their jobs, producing economic mayhem all over the world. But astonishingly, although Wells Fargo was a contributor to one of the largest-ever financial crises, and after a series of financial scandals, U.S. taxpayers had to bail out the bank. Wells Fargo received USD 25 billion of Emergency Economic Stabilization Act funds through a preferred stock purchase by the U.S. Treasury Department. As CBS News put it, “Wells Fargo hit the jackpot. It was one of the first banks to get bailout funds – the biggest amount awarded in a single shot: $25 billion tax dollars.” Nevertheless, to return to its admirable roots and to satisfy its customers’ needs, Wells Fargo should join the bandwagon of the new economic model, which requires a decentralized, borderless, and secure digital currency, such as Bitcoin.

', 'All News is Good News', 'Bitcoin Bullish on Trump Tweet But When Moon?']","  Eustace Cryptus | Jul 14, 2019 | 02:45 On July 11 President Donald Trump tweeted that Bitcoin, Facebook’s Libra and all other cryptocurrencies are basically rubbish when compared to the US dollar. Now Tom Lee has a response.  Earlier this week the US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made media waves and rocked crypto Twitter when he suggested that Bitcoin is a speculative store of value that functions similarly to an investment in gold. President Trump, who is often at loggerheads with the Federal Reserve, quickly responded by tweeting that Bitcoin is not money and simply a speculative instrument which is often used to facilitate crime.   Now, Fundstrat head analyst and partner Thomas Lee has weighed in on the issue and according to him Trump’s tweet will have the unintended effect of bringing more attention to Bitcoin. Lee explained that Trump’s disdain for Bitcoin, Facebook’s Libra and cryptocurrencies in general “makes the other 99% more aware” of Bitcoin and funny enough Trump’s signature phrase “Bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all.”     Bitcoin thrives from attention whether it’s FUD or bullish news and Lee is confident that as cryptocurrency grows in popularity and is more widely held the macro connection of Bitcoin to commodities and traditional markets will lead to a greater correlation between cryptocurrency and the stock market.   According to Lee, this is not necessarily a bad thing as currently exchanges and a few massive wallets hold a huge amount of crypto and this is why there is such violent volatility. Lee believes that as more institutions engage with cryptocurrency the price and liquidity will increase.  When questioned about the future of Bitcoin price, Lee was not shy about sharing his estimate and explained that at the moment Bitcoin is trading within a level that it’s only seen 3% of its historical trading timeline. Lee then said that historically bitcoin has rallied 200 to 400% during the following 4 months and when applied to today’s’ price action this equates to a Bitcoin price of $20,000 to $40,000 by Q4 of 2019.  Yahoo Finance host Zack Guzman then asked Lee to share his thoughts on $13,400 being a stiff resistance level for Bitcoin and Lee said that currently it’s primarily retail investors and whales that trade crypto and technicians are incredibly important to this crowd.  Lee agreed that $13,400 was functioning as a strong short-term resistance but then countered that in finance there is no such thing as a triple top and if this concept applies to Bitcoin then we can expect the digital asset to blast through the resistance on its third attempt.    Later on his Twitter page, Lee did admit that there was one thing that could pose a major hangup for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole but realistically such an extreme measure is unlikely.  Do you think Thomas Lee is correct about his Bitcoin prediction?

As Bitcoin briefly touched $20,000 in early 2018, market analysts forecasted that the impending arrival of Bitcoin futures products, a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), and the infusion of institutional funding would drive Bitcoin towards $30,000 and possibly $50,000. Of course we all know how that story ended, and the start of 2019 has provided a well-needed respite from the 15-month-long bear market that crypto investors endured.  Since April, Bitcoin has been on a real tear and the general consensus revolves around the idea that institutional investors are driving the current rally. It makes sense and is believable considering that Fidelity, Bakkt, TD Ameritrade, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and an uncountable number of venture capitalists have openly shared their intentions for investing in the cryptocurrency sector.  The general expectation is that with institutional support, Bitcoin is now on the path to retaking $20,000. There are also hopes that the digital asset could continue its march on toward $40,000 before the end of 2019.  Well, this conclusion is more of an inaccurate assumption according to Changpeng Zhao (CZ). In a recent interview with Bloomberg, the Binance CEO said that individual investors are still playing a major role in driving Bitcoin price 00 action. CZ said:  We have not seen institutions growing faster… What we’ve seen is pickup in both places. The number of institutions coming into this industry has not increased that tremendously in 2019 yet. CZ explained that retail and institutional trading has continuously increased but retail investors still represent roughly 60% of trading volume on the exchange. This percentage is nearly identical to the previous year’s volume and this is worth noting since mega-companies like Bakkt, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs are said to be deeply involved with cryptocurrency. According to CZ, the growth in activity on Binance can be attributed to margin trading, and on July 11, Binance launched margin trading for its users. The new option allows traders to borrow three times their principal when investing in select cryptocurrencies. The Binance CEO said that 10,000 traders have signed up so far, and borrowed over $15 million on the first day alone. Other exchanges like Kraken and Bitfinex allow traders to borrow from 5 to 100 times their account value and its possible that these traders have helped to drive Bitcoin’s price up by 36% since the start of June.  As an increasing number of exchanges begin to offer margin trading CZ believes that “the majority of people by the end of the year will be using margin in some capacity [as its] quite safe to use, to be honest.” Of course, the result of this will be “more trading volume and potentially higher volatility” but at the moment, an increase in volume is exactly what the market requires.  Do you think margin traders or institutional investment will fuel the next Bitcoin rally?

Everything goes right, and even seemingly unrelated events conspire to work out in your favour? Well Bitcoin just had one of those weeks.  One sign that things are going your way is people saying nice things about you. Or renowned figures of ridicule saying bad things about you. Bitcoin had both this week. First, the US Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, described Bitcoin as a ‘store of value‘ like gold. He also emphasized that the U.S. should not assume that the dollar’s status as a reserve currency would last forever. And of course there was one US Dollar fanboy who wasn’t going to take a perceived sleight like that lying down. US President, Donald J Trump, leapt to the dollar’s defence in his own characteristic style… a poorly written tweet. Suffice to say he is not a fan; Bitcoin isn’t money, and is based on thin air, according to the Trumpster. Google searches for ‘Bitcoin’ spiked at the news. Rather than slinging mud at Bitcoin, Trump may find a better use of his time would be to reduce his country’s spiralling debt. The US Budget Deficit jumped 23.1%, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, warned that the US may run out of cash in early September. Avoiding the risk of this requires congress to approve a raise of the debt-ceiling; essentially used as a safeguard against unlimited government spending. However, they only have a fortnight to agree that before congress breaks up for summer holidays, only reconvening in… mid-September. And we all know how easy it is for Republicans and Democrats to agree on something these days. A good sign that you are doing something right is when your competitors have to change to keep up. Deutsche Bank this week announced 18,000 job losses over the next three years, and a significant investment in tech, to the tune of 13 billion Euros. At the same time, Bitcoin hashrate reached an all-time high, indicating that the network is more secure than ever. So you could say that Bitcoin has had a fairly good week. In fact, Twitter commentator, Rhythm, suggested this may have been Bitcoin’s most bullish week ever. – The Federal Reserve compares bitcoin to gold. – Trump criticizes bitcoin, comparing against the dollar. – Deutsche Bank downsizes 18,000 employees. – US budget deficit jumps 23.1% – Hashrate reaches new all-time high Bitcoin has never had a more bullish week. 🔥 — Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) July 12, 2019  What are your thoughts on the recent bitcoin developments this week?

Most are of the opinion that the sentiment is positive while the actual comments may not have been. Bitcoin is now a household name and even if Donald Trump is not a fan, he has certainly increased the awareness of the nascent industry. Many of the major industry players reacted yesterday with some stating that Trump’s comments were ‘wildly bullish’. CNBC Squawk Box anchor, Joe Kernan, reckons he could convince the POTUS in ten or fifteen minutes. His primary argument was the question of who has the largest vested interest in things staying the way they are. Naturally it is the government so Trump’s negative attitude towards bitcoin is not surprising. Joe Squawk continued with a quote from Tyler Winklevoss who stated: we’ve elected to put our faith into a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error. Co-anchor Becky Quick continued the narrative adding that: Bitcoin was born out of occupy Wall Street and the financial crisis with all these instances where trust in banks and financial institutions, and government had been eroded.

Trump has already stated that he advocates for a weaker dollar in order to compete with his ‘financial foes’ in Europe and China. The arguments for bitcoin and crypto clearly outweigh the negative stance that governments and banks keep trying to push. As co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, Anthony Pompliano, who joined the show stated: “If you said 10.5 years ago the President of the United States is going to be tweeting about magic internet money, we would have never envisioned that day,” Proof of Talent founder Rob Paone laconically quipped on CNBC’s change of stance regarding BTC: CNBC went from charting Bitcoin with crayola crayons to succinctly understanding it’s value prop… Incredible CNBC went from charting Bitcoin with crayola crayons to succinctly understanding it's value prop… Incredible https://t.co/WEsQCw4htB — Rob ""Crypto Bobby"" Paone (@crypto_bobby) July 12, 2019  The fact that bitcoin and crypto is now part of the mainstream media and has even caught the eyes of the US president is testament to the growth of the ten year old digital asset.

BTC has outperformed pretty much all of the other financial investment options on the table by a massive margin. Despite its little downturn recently, bitcoin is still way higher than it was at the beginning of the year. BTC started out on New Year’s Day trading at around $3,750, still frozen solid in the depths of the 2018 crypto winter. Today it is trading at around $11,500 which is a gain of 206%. If we look at the 2019 peak of $13,800 bitcoin made a whopping 268% gain in just six months. BTC price YTD. Coinmarektcap.com The uptrend is still solid and trading volume has surged from around $4.5 billion to over $20 billion per day. Market capitalization as a result has also pumped from $65 billion to over $200 billion over the same period. To get the scope of how significant these gains are we need to take a look at other top invested and traded assets. Oil is second to bitcoin, but it is a long way back with just a 30% gain in 2019. The NASDAQ is next with 26% since the beginning of January and real estate investment trusts (REITs) have made 22% this year. After bitcoin, these are the top three performing traditional assets. Further down the list is the S&P500 which has made 21% and even further down are commodities with an 11% gain. Peter Schiff’s darling, gold, has only managed a 10% increase so far this year, and cash is not even worth mentioning.

Even with a dump of 30% from its 2019 high, Litecoin has still notched up a gain of over 240% this year at current rates. That increase is dwarfed by the 400% Binance Coin has made since it was trading at $6.20 on January first. The new darling of crypto, Chainlink, has cranked a monumental one thousand percent since the beginning of the year when it was trading below $0.30. Even with them still being on the floor, most altcoins are higher now than they were six months ago. Performance aside, there could well be closer ties between bitcoin and oil and gas before the end of the year. That is at least the prediction from one industry observer who claims there will be settlements or royalties in BTC for energy this year: We are going to see settlements for oil and gas payments and/or royalties in Bitcoin by the end of 2019.

Three descending lows are evident on the 30 Minute time-frame alongside descending volume and ascending RSI which is a clear indication of bullish divergence.  On the 30-minute bitcoin price analysis chart, we can see clear bullish divergence playing out. Bright as day, we can see highlighted the descending peaks in both price action and volume. In addition to this, RSI (Relative Strength Index) shows clear ascending momentum. These are the three main points to look out for when trying to gauge bullish divergence, this coupled with the fact that market price is trading at POC (Point of Control) around $11,600 begins to paint a very bullish picture for BTC’s short-term price action. Both the 50MA and 200EMA are sandwiching market price, this is a clear indication of consolidation before a big move. BTC’s volume is at it’s lowest in the last 3 Days and price levels aren’t continuing to dump meaning there’s good support around the current market price. Provided the bullish divergence plays out as expected, price levels could break July’s monthly high of $13,000 over the coming days. The trend is still very much bullish and bears don’t seem to be gaining much momentum as outlined in yesterday’s bitcoin price analysis on BTC. Bullish divergence is simply when the candlesticks create lower lows and your indicators create higher highs. This signals that bearish selling momentum during a pull-back or correction is starting to fade out.

Canadian gas companies in Alberta are developing means of utilizing natural gas to power bitcoin mining farms. This revelation is according to Francis Pouliot of Canada-based BTC mining firm Bull Bitcoin. Tweeting on Wednesday (July 10, 2019), Pouliot says this trend could become useful for gas companies. An excerpt from the tweet reads: Bitcoin solves a massive problem for 1000s of gas well owners. There is overwhelming demand to monetize trapped illiquid energy. Today I visited an Alberta gas company that has been prototyping Bitcoin mining operations with trapped natural gas, too costly to sell onto the grid. Bitcoin solves a massive problem for 1000s of gas well owners. There is overwhelming demand to monetize trapped illiquid energy. — Francis Pouliot ☣️ (@francispouliot_) July 11, 2019  With prices declining over the years, well operators have become disincentivized to collect and transport natural gas. The gas needs to be removed to maintain downhole pressure. The end result is the gas getting flared — burning continuously in an open flame without any energy recovery. Operators cannot, however, flare natural gas ad infinitum as environmental regulators usually have strict limits. Upon reaching the threshold, the wells have to be shut down. Now, gas companies can go another route — install Bitcoin mining ASICs and use the natural gas to power the process. This revelation also reinforces the idea of Bitcoin mining acting as a “buyer of last resort as noted by Coinshares in its latest report. As reported by Bitcoinist, Coinshares says renewable energy powers more than 74% of the total global Bitcoin mining activity. Also, the revelation flies in the face of the usual “ocean boiling” narrative espoused by critics. Bitcoin mining is incentivizing companies to seek greener methods of dealing with petrol-gas. More natural gas powering mining farms means fewer carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere from oil and gas exploration. Oil and gas exploration companies in North America getting into the Bitcoin mining business can also bring about greater decentralization in the arena. China still remains the undisturbed center of BTC mining globally. Bitmain’s fortune reversal in the latter half of 2018 has seen its dominance decrease significantly. However, the company has recently announced plans to upscale its operations in China. With the 2020 block reward halving event approaching, miners are looking to grab a greater share of the total hashing potential. As a result, hash rate has grown astronomically, going above 70 quintillion hashes per second. What do you think about gas-powered bitcoin mining farms?

As Bitcoinist reported, Trump suddenly released thinly-veiled criticism of cryptocurrency as a whole on Friday, a series of tweets claiming it was inferior to the US dollar.  Employing classic arguments favored by many a Bitcoin naysayer, Trump said Bitcoin and crypto fed illicit markets, were too volatile and simply “not money.” The dollar, on the other hand, fulfilled that role while allegedly not featuring in criminal activity like Bitcoin. While many may have expected Bitcoin to nosedive after such a public grilling, the opposite occurred. BTC/USD was up around 1.3% ten hours after the tweets.  What was more telling, however, was that markets initially failed to react at all, proving Bitcoin’s ambivalence to attacks from centralized sources and the political elite. “Trump tweets… BTC does nothing. Bitcoin is now less volatile than Donald Trump,” ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees summarized. Previously, individual comments moved the entire BTC market, an example being last year’s damning report by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and its chief, Augustin Carstens. Well done @realDonaldTrump for bringing more awareness to #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/S6KmLf0cub — NebraskanGooner📈 (@nebraskangooner) July 12, 2019  In the end, the only spike Trump ended up causing was on Google Trends, where interest in ‘Bitcoin’ temporarily surged before leveling off once more.  In the long term, however, Trump may live to regret paying attention to Bitcoin, commentators suggested.  By voicing distaste, Trump not only acknowledged Bitcoin as a major phenomenon of global importance but also laid bare his opposition to a free currency beyond the control of the financial system.  “We finally got that Bitcoin tweet from Trump,” CNBC host Ran Neuner commented, noting the result may not favor Facebook’s fledgling – but centralized – digital currency Libra, which the president also bashed.  “They can’t shut down Bitcoin but Facebook, on the other hand, may have some issues. I say again, the more resistance Facebook face (sic), the more valuable Bitcoin becomes.” That idea may continue to gain traction. The idea of BTC finally getting its ‘Trump pump’ was irresistible for bulls Friday, having eyed potential for the largest cryptocurrency to break all-time highs. As Bitcoinist noted, just days ago, when BTC/USD traded above $13,000, a flood of mainstream media forecasts suggested new records were either “imminent” or due at some point in 2019.  What do you think about Donald Trump’s impact on Bitcoin?

Presumably, in response to the Federal Reserve chair’s comments on bitcoin, Libra, and crypto subjects, the POTUS said that he wasn’t a fan. “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity….” I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019  He has clearly taken the stance of many that do not understand the technology or the concept of value. The volatility comment is fair play and BTC has been anything but stable over the past month or so. Echoing sentiment from US regulators and bankers he added that crypto-assets can facilitate unlawful behavior. Guess what, so does US dollars, and so do banks. Trump’s stance on bitcoin is pretty much expected from one who believes in old school investments and that the dollar is the only true currency of the world. “We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!” Facebook’s highly questionable foray into crypto was also questioned with Trump adding: “Similarly, Facebook Libra’s “virtual currency” will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations,” As expected the crypto community did not take this lying down. While most probably agree with his comments on Facebook, which virtually admitted it would harvest data on Libra purchases, it was the dollar pumping that drew the largest reaction. Tron founder Justin Sun wasted no time inviting Mr T. to lunch with Warren Buffett so that he could dispel the fake news and spread some crypto education. Some of the most pertinent replies focused on the hypocrisy of Trump’s views on the dollar: “Are you saying the US dollar doesn’t facilitate unlawful behavior including drug trade and other illegal activities?” “The U.S. dollar’s value is also “based on thin air.” The gold standard is history. It’s called “fiat currency” for a reason.” Many industry heavyweights agreed that Trump’s bitcoin tweet, while negative, was actually good for the industry with Travis Kling claiming it was ‘wildly bullish’ and Anthony Pompliano adding: “If your argument is that Bitcoin is based on thin air, while Bitcoin’s argument is that it is based on math, who should we believe?” Are Trump’s bitcoin tweets good for the industry?

The team announced the news in a blog post on the Cardano web forum of Monday (July 8, 2019). According to the post, Symphony 2.0 is an attempt to represent the Bitcoin blockchain in a manner that is engaging, stimulating, and entertaining while transforming abstract concepts into tangible sensory information. For the team, apart from creating a visual spectacle, they felt it necessary to utilize sounds like a signature for transaction blocks. Thus, each block in the network has a unique sound.  According to the post, the team achieved this unique sound signature through a process called “additive synthesis.” Each transaction has a distinctive sound thus making every block composed of these transactions having its own special “auditory fingerprint.” Symphony 2.0 feels much like models of the neurons in the brain or indeed the many galaxies in the universe. The design philosophy sees the mempool as a sort of primordial soup visualized in a gravitational swell. The visual interface also sees validated transactions as concentric rings. Each added transaction causes the rings to extend outward like an expanding model of the physical universe. Certain aspects of the Bitcoin blockchain visualization incorporate practical elements like trees representing Merkle trees. Zooming into each block sees validated transactions displayed as 3D hexagons. The followings description from the Symphony 2.0 live environment provide a high-level summary of the project: Transactions are shown as crystals; height is value, brightness is spent output ratio. Each crystal creates sound based on value, spent outputs, and fee. Sounds are cycled through in the order the transactions were made.  Symphony 2.0 is available on web browsers for both mobile and laptop devices. For low-end devices, the developers also advise running the visual simulation on medium quality. The development also plans to create visual blockchain simulations for other networks like Ethereum and Cardano. Commenting on the importance of the project as a tool for greater blockchain education, Cardano forum user and developer of Symphony 2.0, “IOHK_Kevin” declared: Describing blockchains and how they work is hard. We’ve already collected feedback from users who say they are using Symphony to teach others about blockchains. They’re now able to describe complex terms that they once could not by using graphs, charts or traditional block explorers.  There are several real-life examples showing the gaps in knowledge about bitcoin and blockchain as a whole. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, the majority of college students interviewed during a YouTube survey two months ago chose $1 over 1 BTC.

Today, lawmakers expressed their concerns about the threat that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies pose to the financial system, including the possible challenge of bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency. During the second day of Jerome Powell’s testimony, senators reiterated their concern about private corporations, such as Facebook, who with their money and power are now attempting to create their own currency and monetary policy. Lawmakers also worried that the U.S. was lagging behind other nations on real-time payment methods. In this connection, Powell indicated that he had not seen bitcoin used as a payment method. However, he noted, bitcoin is already increasingly taking over gold in the global economy as a store of value. “It’s a store of value” — Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve talking to the Senate Banking Committee about Bitcoin THE VIRUS IS SPREADING 🔥 — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 11, 2019  Lawmakers also mentioned their uneasiness regarding bitcoin’s possible long-term challenge to replace the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency. Powell admitted that this was in the realm of possibility, albeit only in the long term. He also emphasized that the U.S. should not assume that the dollar’s status as a reserve currency would last forever. POWELL: DON'T ASSUME USD STATUS AS RESERVE CURRENCY PERMANENT — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 11, 2019  Powell also said that having the dollar as the world reserve currency conveyed both benefits and costs. And he asserted that to replace the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency, the issuing country would be required to have the rule of law and a highly developed financial system. Regarding Powell’s position on the need for a global reserve currency, Peter Schiff hastened to point out, “Powell is wrong. The world does not need another reserve currency to replace the dollar. Gold is a much better reserve asset than any fiat currency. In fact, gold reserves legitimize the currencies they back. The dollar only became the reserve currency due to its gold backing.” On July 7, 2019, during Powell’s Senate testimony on monetary policy, the value of bitcoin dropped below USD 12,000 after Powell flagged “serious concerns” about Facebook’s planned Libra cryptocurrency. However, bitcoin is already demonstrating its resiliency as it inches back to the USD 12,000 mark.

Barry Silbert Explains,"['Why so Bullish, Bitcoin?', 'Cutting the Supply']","  davitbabayan | Jul 11, 2019 | 15:16 It seemed like yesterday when the price of bitcoin dropped more than 80 percent from its all-time high of $20,000. The moment half the renowned economists and investors rubbished the cryptocurrency as yet another “Tulip Bubble,” “mother of all scams,” and “rat poison squared,” it took the rug under the skeptics’ feet. Seven months after its 2018 bottom, bitcoin is now healthy and wealthy, with its spot rate up by 220 percent. Critics do not want to believe the 2019’s most profitable asset is here to stay. Noted economist Nouriel Roubini still believes that bitcoin will fall to zero. Legendary investor Warren Buffett also thinks that the cryptocurrency has no value. Gold bug Peter Schiff is debating the industry’s bigwigs about bitcoin’s lack of use case. The question remains: if bitcoin is a total sham, then who in his/her right mind has injected approx $152 billion into its market? From where is the money coming? And most importantly, what is making investors join the so-called bitcoin bandwagon? Digital Currency Group Founder and CEO Barry Silbert answers: “If you look at the history of bitcoin trading, there were 80 percent drawdowns in price after all-time highs. Once the market got comfortable that the lows were in, they brought some excited enthusiasts and their money back into the asset class.” Silbert explained the catalysts that drove investors back to a then-bearish market. The angel investor said macroeconomic factors such as the US-China trade war was one thing, but investors appeared more keen towards the upcoming developments in the bitcoin trading industry. He referred to mainstream financial service firms Fidelity Investments, TD Ameritrade, Bakkt, and E*Trade and their plans to offer cryptocurrency trading services to both institutional and retail investors in the second half of 2019. “And then,” Sibert added, “a lot of investors know that in 2020 there is a halving event.” Silbert referred to a practice pre-designed into the Bitcoin protocol, whereby the cryptocurrency’s supply gets reduced by half every four years. The algorithmic move makes it more scarce than gold –  and if the cryptocurrency’s demand goes any higher, a textbook supply-demand economic model screams a bullish outcome for bitcoin. “Each time that has happened in the past, the price of bitcoin has gone by 500-1,000 percent afterward […] So I think there is definitely some buying happening right now,” said Silbert. The next bitcoin halving is taking place in May 2020, he reminded. At press time, the bitcoin price was trading at $11,662 on San Francisco-based Coinbase exchange.

As reported by Quartz Africa, Peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions in Zimbabwe recently reached a new high after President Emmerson Mnangagwa reinstated the Zimbabwe dollar. The ban also prohibits the settlement of local transactions in the British pound, South African rand, the US dollar, and other foreign currencies.  In 2006 Zimbabwe underwent a brutal period of unprecedented hyperinflation and by 2009 Zimbabwe had phased out the Zimbabwe dollar and introduced a multi-currency system. While utilizing a system reliant on foreign currencies eased hyperinflation, it also led to the government losing control of monetary policy. The new foreign currency ban is an attempt to limit the effect of workers’ unions which are petitioning the government for salary payments in foreign currency and in late 2018 the government also banned all local banks from processing Bitcoin transactions. As the policy takes effect, local prices for Bitcoin have risen tremendously and most cryptocurrency users prefer to use EcoCash, a mobile payments platform, for conducting trades within Zimbabwe.  Currently, Zimbabwe is one of the most active markets for cryptocurrency-based commerce and Zimbabweans prefer the digital asset as a stable store of value instead of the Zimbabwe dollar which is notorious for its hyperinflation and difficulty to use.  Golix crypto exchange CEO Tawanda Kembo said: What we are seeing is that there is a lot of demand for Bitcoin and there is little supply compared to demand so all the activity in Bitcoin which we are seeing in happening on dark markets instead of exchanges. As reported by Bitcoinist last week, the introduction of the foreign currency ban on June 24th caused local Bitcoin prices to rise to $76,000 per coin which was 580% higher than the $11,000 price on this date. To say the least, Zimbabweans are far from pleased with the new policy and SureRemit director Olaoluwa Samuel-Biyi said:  Cryptocurrency is the digital version of old Swiss Dinar: The unstoppable money circulating without the government’s consent. Watch Bitcoin usage and prices spike in Zimbabwe, where, like everywhere else, “the full faith of government” is just economic jargon.”  Do you think Bitcoin prices will continue to rise as Zimbabwe bans foreign currency transactions?

As Bitcoinist reported, increasingly resourceful miners had allegedly even moved into mosques, which receive free power, to continue their businesses. Recently, reports emerged authorities wished to impose a moratorium on mining until new electricity pricing deals had finalized, something which now appears to have occurred. “Mining of the international digital currencies should be done based on the price of electricity for export,” Press-TV quoted Abdol Nasser Hemmati, chairman of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), as saying.  “What’s more important is that these mined currencies should be fed back to the national economic cycle.” Last week, an Iranian government minister meanwhile revealed he knew of a Chinese operation involving mining present in Iran.  Ostensibly not part of an intergovernmental deal, Iran’s Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, admitted private and business entities could still be active locally.  “There is no evidence of the activity the Chinese in Iran although I have heard it unofficially,” Press-TV reported him as explaining July 6. “The Chinese government has no plan to be present in the field of cryptocurrency mining in Iran. However, China’s private sector and people may have been involved in this area.” Iran is not alone in shaking up gray-area crypto mining in the face of adversity. Other states continue to follow suit as Bitcoin strengthens, such as the unrecognized republic of Abkhazia, still officially part of Georgia, which earlier this month revealed plans to build a large Bitcoin mining farm. Authorities had previously banned the practice, at a time when the Bitcoin price dive to $3000 had made it broadly untenable as a profitable enterprise. Elsewhere, mining companies are selecting jurisdictions as diverse as Norway and the Mojave Desert to build new plants.  What do you think about Iran’s latest acceptance of Bitcoin mining?

However, this also comes with a greater risk, given the current volatility of the cryptocurrency market.”  The unveiling ends a period of several months during which Binance slowly dropped hints it was working on margin trading, followed by evidence of testing. #Binance Launches Margin Trading service for Evolving Cryptocurrency Traders Binance Margin is now available to all eligible users. #TradingEvolvedhttps://t.co/GPDIwKtO6E pic.twitter.com/85DtUtsJC5 — Binance (@binance) July 11, 2019  In June 2019, demand for leveraged financial tools tied to Bitcoin 00 and other cryptocurrencies is higher than ever, as markets return to levels not seen since before the 2018 bear market.  Huge amounts of capital come and go at the hands of margin traders daily, social media users often noting how sudden movements in the Bitcoin price trigger giant liquidations in a matter of minutes.  This week, a Bitcoin uptick saw $44 million worth of liquidations on derivatives giant BitMEX in just a single morning. Margin trading essentially involves borrowing funds to use as collateral while betting on a token’s price moving in a certain direction. Should the bet go wrong, the trader faces liquidation. Binance’s product is now available to everyone with an eligible account; this means that those residing in the US, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Crimea, Canada, Japan, South Korea, and Cuba are currently unable to join in.  The situation remained the same as Binance rolled out previous new tools such as its expanded decentralized exchange (DEX), while executives admitted that it would be impossible to prevent anyone from using a decentralized structure.  News of the margin trading meanwhile went some way to stemming losses of Binance’s in-house Binance Coin 00 token, which delivered 24-hour losses of 6 percent. Following a downturn in the Bitcoin price, altcoin markets have broadly slumped, shedding up to 20 percent overnight as BTC/USD fell by around $1500. Last month, BNB had reached new all-time highs of close to $40 per coin. What do you think about Binance’s margin trading launch for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

In late June 2019, Lolli — a browser extension service, announced a new partnership with Hotels.com. The company has also inked deals with notable brands like Walmart and Best Buy. People who use the browser extension while on shopping on these platforms can earn valuable rebates in BTC. The company says it has over 500 of these strategic partnerships and that shoppers can get up to 30% back on their purchases in satoshis. For Lolli chief, Alex Adelman, bitcoin rebates are an ingenious way to get more people interested in BTC and virtual currencies. Rather than having to acquire BTC from an exchange, Adelman says the rewards program enables people to earn bitcoin via online shopping.  Data from Coinmap.org shows that there are currently a little over 15,000 venues across the globe that accept bitcoin. Back in February 2019, this figure stood at over 14,300, indicating an increase of about 5%. As quoted by Forbes, Adelman speaking at the recently concluded Bitcoin 2019 conference in San Francisco, said: When you can incentivize someone with something for free that, so far since we launched, has 3xed in value, you start to train the savvy shopper. For Adelman and others in the cryptocurrency rebates arena, the ultimate goal is to encourage widespread crypto adoption. The Lolli CEO believes that past attempts to entrench BTC payment adoption focused too much on the merchant side not sparing enough consideration for the consumer end of the spectrum. According to the Lolli chief, when consumers begin to see the growing value of their stacked sats gotten from these rebates, retailers will see the need to adopt BTC payments. By so doing, both buyer and seller would have a mutually beneficial reason to adopt bitcoin payment. Apart from Lolli, there are other startups that are attempting to use crypto rebates to incentivize consumers for greater virtual currency adoption. GoJoy recently completed a $10 million token sale. The company is also planning to list its native token on the CBX crypto exchange. According to reports, the listing will see Joy Coin paired with cryptos like BTC, ETH, and USDT. Can rebate programs like this significantly increase bitcoin adoption among retail shoppers?

The question remains as to whether the strength of the current bullish trend will be enough to propel price levels upwards out of the current rising wedge, which is notoriously one of the most reliable bearish trading patterns. See here for more information on where BTC’s price could be heading for the remainder of 2019.  On the 1 Hour chart, we can clearly see the most recent sell-off within the rising wedge pattern over the last few hours. During this time RSI has turned oversold indicating bears are in control of the intra-minute price action. However, despite this, the current short-term trend is still very much bullish. Clear red volume supports the most recent sell-off, however price action is still within the rising wedge and could bounce very soon. Key support levels to look out for if price levels break-down from the rising wedge are $11,750, $11,275, $10,700, $10,300, and $9,300. These are sensible levels to re-enter or take profit on shorts if you catch the break-down. It’s likely price levels will re-visit POC around $11,275 before carrying on the bullish uptrend as stated in my previous Bitcoin price analysis. The order books are very thin above the current market price of $12,067 meaning there’s very little resistance in terms of resting orders in the market in comparison to the current level of volume that is being traded from day to day on Bitcoin. This is a strong indication that further upside is to come well above $14,000 and also means the price action will move quickly presenting lots of opportunities for leverage traders in the market.  On the 1 Month chart, we can see the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator is oversold clearly showing bulls are in control of the current trend. POC (Point of Control) has yet to move up from $6,7770. If BTC was to see a huge re-trace which is increasingly likely when you look back at previous bull runs, there’s always been a 40%+move to the downside before new ATH’s have been hit, then POC would be the best point in which to consider scaling back into BTC. Price levels are currently jammed between the 0.382 and 0.5 fib which is typically a zone where price levels like to consolidate and move sideways, which we have yet to see on BTC. This could be an indication that the rising wedge on the hourly chart could break resulting in consolidation or sideways movement between these price points of $11,200 and $13,000. This would allow altcoins a much-needed breather, allowing them to bounce from their all-time lows, this would also likely see the overall cryptocurrency market-cap surpass the currently yearly highs of $350B.

He made the revelation in an interview with Bloxlive TV. Balina, a vlogger and creator of some of the most cringe-worthy crypto-related songs ever, didn’t appear to have been invited to talk about Bitcoin. Interviewer, Layah Heilpern, initially asked about his ‘Diary Of A Made Man’ channel; How it had evolved from a simple travel blog, into one of the most popular cryptocurrency YouTube channels. At the height of ICO-mania in 2017, Balina was one of the biggest influencers in the field. Then he explained his ‘Token Metrics’ investment strategy; Leveraging data and analytics to find patterns in investing in ICOs and cryptocurrencies. Heilpern questioned him as to what makes a really good start-up to invest in. His three key requirements: product and technology, an all-star team, and the advisers on-board. He added the actual ‘token metrics’ as an afterthought. So, after shilling his blog and his investment strategy, the interviewer moved on to Bitcoin’s rollercoaster rally in Q2 of this year. “Is Bitcoin king, and will it replace gold?” she asked. Balina responded with an unequivocal “Yes,” tempered only with his standard disclaimer that it was “definitely not financial advice.” Bitcoin is king. Bitcoin has shown us this entire year why it’s still king. Altcoins haven’t really kept up with Bitcoin at all. He continued by saying that even he, who is known for investing heavily in altcoins, is “really thinking of becoming a Bitcoin maximalist.” Will #bitcoin replace gold?🤑 Is #bitcoin King?🔥@DiaryofaMadeMan tells me YES! 📢He's thinking of becoming a #BitcoinMaximalist!

There are only so many video-blogs you can make saying ‘Buy Bitcoin, the whole Bitcoin, and nothing but the Bitcoin’. Whilst some were quick to applaud Balina’s (perhaps accidental) admission, others questioned his credibility. Some suggested that with no ICOs to shill, he was forced to get on the BTC bandwagon. Others that this would have been ‘a somewhat respectable dialogue at $3k’, but was a little late now. Some commenters even suggested that Balina’s move towards BTC was probably a good indicator for an impending alt-season. So how did Balina’s opinions become so maligned? Well, everyone is naturally wary of a shill for starters. Especially one as shameless as Balina. But the kicker may have been his questionable claim as to being hacked for $2m, allegedly to avoid tax. A good reputation is very easy to lose in the crypto-world.

My mind is open. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 9, 2019  The market forecaster and chairman of SchiffGold — one of the largest international precious metal dealers, has a history of denying the prominence of BTC. This stance hasn’t stopped Schiff from keeping a bitcoin wallet. SchiffGold even adopted BTC as a payment method. From calling bitcoin worthless back in 2017, Schiff has moved on to declaring that BTC does have some appeal but governments could shut it down easily. Since sharing his BTC address, the veteran gold-bug has received over $2,000 in bitcoin donations. These donations have been much to the chagrin of some commentators who say there are more deserving people who should receive these donations.  For Schiff, the open challenge to people to change his mind about BTC is a payback for the donations received thus far. Gold-bugs and bitcoin bulls do, however, have a point of consonance. Both sides believe there is an imminent market crisis. These forecasts come even as the economy appears to be stronger than it has been in recent times. However, many expect the Federal Reserve to adopt a more dovish monetary policy which could have serious implications for the market going forward. Speaking to CNBC earlier this week, David Roche of Independent Strategy predicted that gold could reach $2,000 before the end of the year. The price of gold is up almost 10 percent since the start of the year, even briefly topping $1,400 at the back end of June — a multi-year high. For bitcoin bulls like Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital, any market situation that takes gold to $2,000 would cause an even greater parabolic rise in the spot price of BTC. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Max Keiser believes BTC can easily move 25-30x faster than gold. For Keiser, the smart money will choose to use bitcoin as a hedge once the Fed goes dovish. Do you think bitcoin will replace gold as the de facto store of wealth? Let us know in the comments below. Images via Twitter @PeterSchiff and Blockchain.com.

That figure had cemented BTC/USD’s highest monthly close in history last month, with analysts now eyeing an easy run to beating the figure yet again at the end of July. At press time, Bitcoin was still holding onto support at $13,000, recovering from an initial drop to $12,785. For Lee, Facebook’s Libra digital currency token – and the potential for other social media giants to issue similar concepts – will meanwhile also serve to drive interest in Bitcoin. The theory is a popular one, Bitcoinist reporting on various figures likewise identifying the chance for Bitcoin to profit from the new financial products. “The fact that Facebook and likely other FAANG companies are going to create their own digital currencies is validating the idea that digital money is here to stay,” he continued. “I think all-time highs are imminent.” Fundstrat Global Advisors' Thomas Lee shares his take on Bitcoin's rally pic.twitter.com/bQ0nIFssSW — Power Lunch (@PowerLunch) July 9, 2019  Bitcoin bulls are coming out with ever more buoyant soundbites this week in the face of a gravity-defying price market.  As Bitcoinist mentioned, CNBC had itself just hosted Morgan Creek founder Mark Yusko, who appeared more confident than ever as he warned over stock markets and predicted BTC/USD would hit $30,000 in the current bull cycle.  “…I think we’re in the next parabolic move,” he said Sunday. “That will probably take us into the $30,000 level before we get another little correction[.]” In just two years, Yusko added, Bitcoin would see a giant $100,000 price tag. While some sources remain bearish or hands-off on Bitcoin, meanwhile, other former naysayers appear to be coming round in the 2019 bull run.  In particular, serial investment veteran Mark Mobius let slip to mainstream media he would have no choice but to buy Bitcoin if current price performance continued much longer.  Mobius, while remaining suspicious about Bitcoin’s uses, stopped short of saying the cryptocurrency had “no value,” as he had done in 2017 when it traded at its all-time high of $20,000.

Published by research firm Messari on July 9, the five-year returns of the world’s six biggest lenders make for grim reading when valued in BTC.  According to Messari, since 2014, Deutsche Bank returns have fallen 98.9 percent in Bitcoin terms.  The stricken German institution, which this week began mass staff layoffs which will affect 18,000 people, fared the worst out of the banks under comparison. Next was Wells Fargo, which managed a 95.3 percent reduction, followed by Morgan Stanley and Citigroup on 92.9 percent and 92.2 percent respectively. Bank of America came in at 90.4 percent, while the ‘best’ performer was JPMorgan, the US’ biggest bank, which saw an 89.5 percent drop in BTC terms. “They say a picture is worth a thousand words,” Messari researcher Jack Purdy commented while uploading the findings on Twitter.

As Bitcoinist reported, a sense of unease pervades the industry following the announcement of Facebook’s Libra protocol, which could spawn new ways of circumventing the banking system for lay consumers. China’s central bank became the latest institution to announce development of its own digital currency this week, officials confirming it was a direct response to Libra and the possibility of it being tied to the US dollar.  At the same time, new data from the US has placed the risk of the world’s biggest economy sliding into recession at its highest since the 2008 financial crisis.  The statistics came courtesy of the New York Fed’s recession index, which Bloomberg journalist Tracy Alloway reproduced on social media.  Despite these risks, however, banking sources continue to play down the impact of cryptocurrency on the wider economy.  During a social media Q&A session this week, the European Central Bank (ECB) described Bitcoin as not a currency, arguing it was too unpredictable to add to its own reserves.  “Bitcoin is not a currency, it rather is an asset and it is very volatile,” the bank’s chief economist Philip Lane responded. The ECB has traditionally held a trivial view of cryptocurrency, in May claiming its impact on the wider economy was negligible in a dedicated report.  What do you think about the performance of banks versus Bitcoin?

One of the main problems facing the cryptocurrency is tax treatment. In this regard, Singapore is now taking the lead. Several countries, such as Japan and Switzerland, are already taking action to boost the growth of their crypto industry. Most recently, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), acknowledging the importance and growth of crypto assets, proposed legislation to exempt cryptocurrencies from the Goods and Services Tax (GST), also known as value-added tax (VAT). The IRAS e-Tax Guide (Draft), dated July 5, 2019, highlights, “Global development and growth in the use of cryptocurrencies have caused tax jurisdictions to review their GST position on cryptocurrencies transactions. Similarly, IRAS has reviewed its GST position to keep up to date with these developments.” The new tax treatment would take effect on January 1, 2020. In contrast, U.S. tax authorities seem to be aiming to stifle the nascent crypto industry with stricter controls. As award-winning writer Adriana Hamacher reports, “The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposes electronic surveillance to weed out Bitcoin tax evasion.” A few members of the U.S. Congress are becoming increasingly aware that the U.S. is falling behind other countries in the crypto industry. As a result, some of them are now considering bills aiming to clarify legal questions surrounding cryptocurrencies and thus stimulate the development of this new industry. Presently, the U.S. IRS considers Bitcoin and all other all cryptocurrencies as property for U.S. federal tax purposes. Buying Bitcoin is not a taxable transaction. However, paying with Bitcoin to buy something else is considered a sale of Bitcoin, such as the sale of a property. Consequently, it is a taxable event. The IRS notice IR-2018-71, issued on March 23, 2018, states, “Virtual currency transactions are taxable by law, just like transactions in any other property.” This tax treatment might soon change. Some policymakers are pressuring the IRS to update its 2014 guidance on cryptocurrencies, which according to the Wall Street Journal, could happen within weeks. Taxes and the imposition of stringent regulations certainly disincentivize any budding industry. Thus, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are hopeful that the forthcoming IRS guidance update will consider adequate tax incentives to stimulate the growth of the American crypto industry.

One of them has converted an Apollo space mission guidance computer into a Bitcoin mining rig. Ken Shirriff is a man with a passion, and that passion lies in the restoration of vintage computer hardware. For his latest project, Shirriff got hold of a guidance computer from the Apollo space mission. Then got it working again; the only working example, according to him. This computer was small enough to install in the actual Apollo craft, in an era when most computers ranged in size from large refrigerator to entire room. Of course, once you have such a machine up and running, you ought to give it something to do. After all, it’s not as though there are that many lunar landings for it to guide these days. But what function to give it?… In the words of Shirriff himself: Trying to mine Bitcoin on this 1960s computer seemed both pointless and anachronistic, so I had to give it a shot. Implementing the SHA-256 hashing algorithm into the 15-bit machine was a struggle, although you could probably have guessed that. However, Shirriff succeeded, as can be seen in the video below.  As you would imagine, it was far from the fastest mining machine out there. It took 5.15 seconds for one SHA-256 hash, and as Bitcoin uses a double hash this gives a rate of just under 0.01 hashes per second. At this rate, Shirriff calculates that it would take about a billion times the age of the universe to mine a block. However it isn’t the slowest Bitcoin mining method he has attempted. Previous projects include mining using an old punch-card computer system, and even mining a block by hand. For comparison, the punch-card experiment was able to compute a Bitcoin hash in 80 seconds, and the rate using pencil and paper was 0.67 hashes per day. Clearly, none of this will make Shirriff a bitcoin millionaire. But his dedication to preserving computing technologies of the past should clearly be applauded. Let’s just hope that he doesn’t convert any more Apollo Guidance Computers into mining rigs though. Or the Cambridge University project to calculate real-time Bitcoin network energy demands may have to recalibrate its worst case efficiency scenario. Can you build a Bitcoin mining rig by yourself?

On the Weiss crypto website, bitcoin currently holds the top spot with an A– grade. This latest grade marks BTC’s highest ever score on the rankings. For the first few iterations of the rankings, bitcoin stayed outside the top ten with the agency assigning a score of C+ back in January 2018.  Only a month ago did bitcoin move from a B– to a B on the log supplied by the independent rating agency. In a letter from Martin D. Weiss, founder of Weiss Ratings, quoted by Forklog, Weiss declared: After touching bottom in December, Bitcoin quadrupled in value in less than 190 days. And today, the reward it delivers investors outweighs the risks. Its technology has been upgraded. Its network is back to normal. Bitcoin’s ascent to the top of the Weiss ranking is in many ways a representation of the renaissance undergone within the technology itself. Upgrades like SegWit and transaction batching have helped to unclog the blockchain. Since the start of the year, Weiss Ratings has even issued positive remarks about BTC. Back in January 2019, the independent rating agency forecasted that bitcoin will reach all-time high and that top-ranked crypto would experience massive adoption. By the end of Q1 2019, Weiss Rating upped the ante proclaiming BTC to best positioned to become a popular store of value. A breakdown of the current rating for BTC sees its tech/adoption and risk/reward grades at ‘A’ and ‘B” respectively. This places bitcoin is the most technically and fundamentally superior of all the cryptocurrencies. Since experiencing a hash rate drop back in December 2018, the computing power utilized to protect the network has risen sharply to a new ATH above 60 quintillion hashes per second. The Bitcoin network hashrate has just recorded its fastest growth in history. $BTC Bitcoin's total hashrate (on a 7-day moving average) has increased by 13.11 EH/S over the past 30 days – its fastest pace ever.

Back in June 2019, the World Bank forecasted global economic growth rate shrinking to 2.6%. For Keiser, the current economic climate favors increased capital inflow into Bitcoin rather than gold or other haven assets. According to the bitcoin bull: It takes 25 – 30x greater capital flow into Gold to move it 1% than Bitcoin. Bitcoin will move 25 -30x faster to the upside than Gold as banks implode.

Bitcoin bulls believe the top-ranked cryptocurrency will serve as the de facto hedge against any uncertainties in the mainstream market. Also tweeting on Monday, Alex Krüger also pointed to the decoupling between BTC and the altcoin market showing the directional flow of money into the crypto scene favoring Bitcoin. Notice the divergence in performance between bitcoin and altcoins. This is how smart money flowing into crypto looks like. — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) July 8, 2019  BTC is up more than 230%, having once again gone beyond the $12,000 price mark. Gold’s performance year-to-date stands under 10% with a temporary climb above the $1,400 price barrier at the end of June 2019. As previously reported by Bitcoinist several commentators are hopping on the “bitcoin is a haven asset” bandwagon, including state-run media establishments in China.  Keiser has on several occasions declared that the Federal Reserve pivoting from hawkish to dovish policies will further weaken the global economy, catapulting Bitcoin into even greater prominence. U.S. President Donald Trump continues to put pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates, accusing China and Europe of currency manipulation. Indeed, central banks around the world are adopting similar monetary policies revolving around lowering interest rates and quantitative easing (QE). Meanwhile, the latest U.S. ‘jobs report’ shows payroll growing by 224,000 in June 2019. With the economy apparently ‘doing well,’ it seems counterproductive to adopt loose monetary policies like quantitative easing. Some commentators say such moves create the illusion of easy money to throw into the stock market reminiscent of the situation existing before the 2008 financial crisis.

Price action looks to now be forming a rising wedge type pattern that should see BTC re-test POC around $11,250.  On the 60 Minute Chart for Bitcoin price analysis, we can clearly see the recent convincing breakout to the upside that took place on July 8th around 08:00 AM just over 30 Hours ago. Both the 50MA and 200EMA have clearly broken out of the asymmetrical triangle as well, clearly showing a clear breakout has taken place. My first profit target of around $12,800 has been hit over the last few hours. Price action has now formed what appears to be a rising wedge as price levels near a big resistance point around $12,900. It’s likely that BTC will need to come back down to POC around $11,300 to sustain such incredible growth, if price action breaks down from the rising wedge this is where I’ll be looking to re-enter. Please bear in mind the trend is still very much bullish and we could see highs around $13,900 re-tested before any type of pull-back to POC (Point of Control) levels highlighted by the yellow line through the middle of my chart. On the Daily chart for Bitcoin price analysis, we can see the most recent breakout to the upside has caused Maxx Momentum indicator (very similar to MACD), to cross back over the median to the upside resulting in green bullish momentum returning, which was seen during the prior move to current the current high of $13,900. Similar to the 60 Minute chart POC (Point of Control) sits around $11,250. Typically with such bullish moves, it’s safe to assume price levels will re-visit POC to sustain such movements. If Maxx Momentum indicator gains strong momentum back and bulls break the yearly high of $13,900 the next sensible profit target would be around $16,300 located around the 1.618 Fibonacci level. One key resistance point coming up that will largely dictate if short-term price levels have much further upside to come is $12,900 which is currently the 0.786 Fibonacci level. There appears to be a large number of resting orders at this level meaning a substantial amount of volume would be required to break this level. Once the key resistance point around $12,900 is broken there’s very little resistance between that point and levels close to BTC’s ATH around $20,000 meaning price action will likely move extremely quickly whilst around these price levels. It’s important to understand that anyone caught up within this price action will likely face to the wrath of the market maker whose ultimate goal is to liquidate both shorts and longs, meaning large wicks and unpredictable price action will likely occur at this point. We have seen this happen many times. Do you think BTC will break key resistance around $12,900 over the coming days? or do you think price levels need to return back to POC around $11,250?

BitMarket announced on Monday that it ran out of liquidity on July 8, which prompted them to cease their operations for an indefinite period. The exchange also said it would update users with more updates. Data provided by CoinMarketCap.com, updated 17 hours ago, showed volumes of close to $850,000. Compared to other exchanges, the statistics appeared weaker, validating that BitMarket was in a liquidity crisis. Nevertheless, the exchange left no clues about how it would go ahead with fund withdrawals. Scared users shared their grievances on social media platforms, with one of them noting a string of red flags. Redditor ODOBANKS claimed that BitMarket was acting shady before making its announcement. The exchange allegedly asked users to change their passwords without providing any explanation. It later revised the users’ API profiles. In a separate instance, BitMarket also halted the withdrawal process of many users, demanding additional KYC. “Exchange representatives, active on Polish bitcoin forum, claimed that this was the long-overdue KYC requirement and that they were only targeting people with expired IDs,” wrote ODOBANKS. “They never addressed users’ accusations of hiding the fact that the exchange has been hacked.” BitMarket currently holds approximately 1,300 Bitcoin units in its wallets, which is equivalent to $16 million. Users under the stress of losing their hard-earned money have already formed a Facebook group. They are planning to file a class-action lawsuit against BitMarket founders and other top executives. Experts have also started weighing in their opinions about recovering the missing users’ money. Noted economist Professor Krzysztof Piech told CHIP that clients cannot reimburse their bitcoin funds at this point. The expert reminded people about an intrinsic flaw in the Bitcoin protocol that grants ownership of bitcoin tokens only to the people who have access to their wallets’ private keys. “In such a situation, clients may apply to the prosecutor’s office,” said Professor Piech. “However, it should be remembered that such funds are complicated to recover. The prosecutor’s office does not have experience in handling such situations. Not to mention the technical difficulties involved.” Just as Bitcurex was not able to recover funds of customers, it will probably be the case with BitMarket, he added. The situation has left users with only one hope: that BitMarket would show up with a plan to reimburse their funds. While many don’t believe it would happen, there is still a lot to learn about trusting exchanges with zero prior credibilities. Kraken exchange CEO Jesse Powell in January pleaded his clients not to store all their cryptocurrencies on the platform. He said: “PLEASE do not store more coins on an exchange, including KrakenFX, than you need to actively trade. Use Ledger or Trezor. Decentralized exchanges are not a panacea — look at The DAO. Open source just means exploits will be discovered sooner (probably not by good guys).” Is BitMarket stopping operations another classic Bitcoin exit scam?

As various media outlets including South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported July 8, China’s central bank said it was already in the process of building the digital token.  The impetus, sources said, came directly from Facebook unveiling the infrastructure for a cryptocurrency of its own, Libra, which will operate outside of the banking system.  “If [Libra] is widely used for payments, cross-border payments in particular, would it be able to function as money and accordingly have a large influence on monetary policy, financial stability, and the international monetary system?”  SCMP quoted Wang Xin, director of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC)’s research bureau, as querying.  The PBoC also revealed it had gained permission from Beijing to begin the process of designing the token. Concerns stem from Libra’s threat to Chinese cross-border payments and even financial sovereignty, due in part to Facebook potentially pegging it to the US dollar. While Libra has not yet issued or even created any tokens, governments, and banks the world over are monitoring it, including the PBoC, which is paying “high attention.” “If the digital currency is closely associated with the US dollar, it could create a scenario under which sovereign currencies would coexist with US dollar-centric digital currencies,” Wang continued.  “But there would be in essence one boss, that is the US dollar and the United States. If so, it would bring a series of economic, financial and even international political consequences.” While Wang did not mention decentralized cryptocurrencies, commentators subsequently argued Libra would draw attention to Bitcoin 00, which would add to the PBoC’s nightmare. “Agree this will ultimately drive Bitcoin to accelerated adoption,” Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano wrote on Twitter following the news. As Bitcoinist reported, China’s concerns over Libra may end up unwarranted if regulators elsewhere succeed in throttling further development.  This month will see dialog open between Facebook and the U.S., where lawmakers have already requested a halt to activity pending further details.  Elsewhere, other sources have delivered grim predictions for the project, with one economist stating that Russia would automatically ban not just the token, but all Facebook-owned platforms should issuance to users go ahead. Moscow subsequently said it would not issue new legislation governing Libra while appearing unfazed by the idea anyone could use it to avoid the banking system.  China meanwhile maintains a blanket ban on trading cryptocurrency, something users are nonetheless seeking to circumvent using methods such as over-the-counter (OTC) platforms and stablecoin Tether. The country previously saw premiums for purchasing Tether in USD terms, underscoring investor demand as Bitcoin soared in value this year.

Yusko is also a partner and co-founder of Morgan Creek’s digital currency spin-off, Morgan Creek Digital. “We’re definitely going to revisit old highs,” he told the network’s Fast Money segment. Bitcoin has surprised investors this week after defying expectations of a bearish retraction to continue reclaiming lost ground from previous weeks.  Investors are currently enjoying weekly gains of 30 percent, while monthly performance has now passed 61 percent. For Yusko, however, current activity marks just the start of 2019’s Bitcoin price action. BTC, he says, will finish this round of enthusiastic growth far above its 2017 all-time highs of $20,000. “…I think we’re in the next parabolic move,” he continued. “That will probably take us into the $30,000 level before we get another little correction[.]”  Continuing, the investor repeated a forecast he had made during a recent webinar, arguing BTC/USD could reach $100,000 in the medium term with little effort. “…The path to $100,000 by 2021 is really quite easy to draw out,” he concluded. Yusko was coming off bearish statements about stock markets, during which he argued a state of overselling would ultimately trigger losses. Investors were also failing to understand the reasons for a US federal interest rate cut, he said.  This week meanwhile has already seen increasingly complimentary words on Bitcoin from another major investment mogul who had previously rubbished it.  Mark Mobius, the veteran who in 2017 said cryptocurrency had no value, now said that if the Bitcoin price continues to grow, he would have to get exposure.  “At the end of the day, there are many people who do believe in it, and if it continues and grows, then I would probably have to be a buyer and be involved with this,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg.  At press time Tuesday, BTC was trading at around $12,500, trending downwards from a local high of $12,800.  Earlier, trading sources, including well-known forecaster Peter Brandt, had warned that substantial downside could soon result as markets take stock of weeks of parabolic growth.

But haven’t we seen all this before? A new article suggests that Benjamin Franklin was doing the equivalent over 250 years ago. Of course, 250 years ago, Bitcoin was still just a twinkle in (Dr) Craig Wright’s ancestor’s eye… Just kidding. But, the America of 250 years ago was heading for a revolution of its own. One which we can attribute at least in part to the financial impositions of its ruling state. As a British colony, America bought more goods from Britain than it sold back. This caused a lack of liquidity, so the colonists started to print their own money. Benjamin Franklin started printing paper money in 1726, making him arguably, the Bitcoin miner of his time. However the American colonists had little gold, and simply by printing more than they could back, the value began to depreciate. The British stepped in with Currency Acts in 1951 and 1964, to control the creation of new currency in the colonies. However these were unpopular, and a desire for financial sovereignty became one of the drivers for the American Revolution. The key to successful money is trust in the system. People will only accept money if they believe that they will be able to use that money in the future. The US Dollar would appear to have done very well for itself, having risen to become the defacto world reserve currency. But it is no more backed with anything now than those first colonial paper money experiments were then. A spiralling national debt has meant that worldwide trust in the dollar is declining. The rise in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has some in the US government so scared of losing their power that they call to ban it. Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to be a trustless system. We do not need to rely on third parties who control and limit its use. Of course, the general public still needs to understand and trust that this system requires none. As that continues to happen perhaps the writing will be on the wall for the dollar as a world reserve currency. Would Benjamin Franklin have liked Bitcoin? He certainly believed in financial sovereignty for the fledgling nation of the American colony. There is no reason to believe that he wouldn’t extend that dream of financial sovereignty to the individual. Do you think Benjamin Franklin was the first person to achieve financial sovereignty, as an ‘erstwhile Bitcoin miner’? Comment below!

The chairman of Roubini Macro Associates called the cryptocurrency a “total flop” because it allocates power to only a handful of people. He claimed that almost every business activity that took place inside the Bitcoin industry has turned centralized. Mining, for instance, is now in the hands of a few big players, as not envisioned in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. Exchanges, too, practice significant control over the cryptocurrency’s liquidity and price. Roubini also noted that a higher percentage of Bitcoin wealth belongs to a lesser number of people, which means they could move the cryptocurrency trend in any direction based on their preferences. Excerpts: “Vitalik Buterin [the Ethereum co-founder] spoke about the inconsistent trinity. You can only encrypt something decentralized, scalable, and secure. Crypto does not satisfy even one of them let alone two of them.”  The statements appeared during a debate with BitMEX CEO & co-founder Arthur Hayes held last week at the Asia Blockchain Summit 2019 in Taiwan’s Taipei. Mayes projected Bitcoin as a technology that gives people financial security and freedom without needing a bank while Roubini dissented entirely. The economist went on bashing Bitcoin for its lack of security, citing how centralized exchanges controlled 99 percent of the cryptocurrency trading. They didn’t have what it takes to secure their clients’ funds, which is reflective in the higher number of hacking incidents that took place in the past decade. Roubini further thrashed the idea of having public keys as a mean to protect oneself against an exchange’s immaturity, stating that anybody with a gun can force a person into sharing those private keys. “If somebody holds me to a gunpoint and take me to an ATM, then there is 300 bucks out of me not $300 million. Bitcoin is completely insecure,” said Roubini. “Instead of being a sophisticated financial system, it goes back to the stone age.” Hayes, on the other hand, believed that letting people have complete ownership of their money is what Bitcoin excelled at entirely. “Bitcoin is for personal sovereignty. If you hold your keys, you are much less likely to lose them,” he reasoned. On Nouriel Roubini’s remarks on centralization in Bitcoin mining, Hayes explained to the scholar that a mining pool does not necessarily mean a single operator’s control over the Bitcoin network. A pool comprises of many small miners allocating a certain percentage of computation power to confirm and add blocks on the blockchain. “Bitcoin,” added Hayes, “has not faced a single 51 percent attack happening on the network and destroying the value. Because at the end of the day, if a miner or group of miners colluded to, say, reverse transactions, they would essentially bring the infrastructure’s worth down to zero. It is not in their interest to violate these rules and that is the whole point and that is why Bitcoin is more secure than any centralized system.” Do you buy Dr. Doom’s ‘Bitcoin is bullshit’ narrative?

Every so often, anti-Bitcoin rhetoric rears its head. Most times, the sentiments expressed appear to be no more educated than the FUD espoused by BTC critics immediately after Silk Road and Mt. Gox. According to Australian crypto news outlet Micky, Switzer called for governments to ban Bitcoin. Commenting further, the Switzer Financial Group chief: I think cryptocurrencies are unnecessary, risky and good for a small group of enthusiasts but the cons, and I repeat the cons, outweigh the pros by a long chalk. Ban bitcoin and its imitators or simply regulate them, so light is shone on this dark, dark world. Switzer ticks off all the major talking points entrenched in the anti-crypto playbook even referring to comments made by Joseph Stiglitz back in May 2019 calling for cryptos to be shut down.  On the subject of banning Bitcoin, the reality seen in some places around the world is that such moves tend to have the opposite effect. The market is driven underground with people having to pay more to acquire BTC. Price premiums arise, and Bitcoin becomes an even more valuable and volatile asset in those particular countries, case in point, China and India. BTC has no central location that can be unplugged to block access. Switzer’s characterization of cryptos having more cons than pros displays a shocking ignorance of the value that virtual currency payment technology has created across the globe. People in places like Venezuela, Turkey and other areas experiencing economic turmoil have adopted Bitcoin. This shows the utility of the cryptocurrency in fiat dystopias. Recent fines for JUST the laundering of money: Wachovia – $160mDeutsche Bank – $670mBank of Australia – $700mING – $900mCitigroup – $237mStandard Chartered – $967mCommerzbank – $1.45bHSBC – $1.9bJPMorgan – $2.05b Banks are just complex laundramats. — Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) July 6, 2019  Switzer also makes reference to Bitcoin and its “dark, dark world.” Perhaps the ‘finance expert’ is unaware of the over $9 billion in recent fines imposed on mainstream banks for money laundering alone. In June 2018, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) agreed to pay a $530 million fine to settle a suit involving money laundering and terrorist financing. If Bitcoin is supporting the dark underworld, one wonders what to say of banks like JPMorgan and Commerzbank that have been hit with fines totaling $3.5 billion. Perhaps instead of banning Bitcoin, the government should look to the likes of serial money laundering offenders like Wells Fargo with over $15 billion in penalty fines since 2000. Should governments ban banks caught facilitating money laundering and befriend Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below. Images via Twitter @Rhythmtrader.

Structured products and bond-like derivatives are being conjured up to attract sophisticated investors. While the institutions have yet to arrive in their droves, the 2019 Bitcoin price rally has attracted greater interest in some of these esoteric products according to Zero Hedge. The report cites an original article by the WSJ published last week. It states that this rally has had a similar effect to the 2017 one which spawned the birth of Bitcoin futures. Products such as reverse convertibles are structured offerings that generally consist of a high-yield, short-term note of the issuer. They are linked to the performance of an unrelated reference asset, in this case, Bitcoin. Zero Hedge adds that extreme caution must be exercised for those considering trading these products. “We all remember how Wall Street banks’ creation of synthetic CDOs and other complex derivatives tied to housing worked out. Some assets simply aren’t well-suited for these types of derivatives.” Demand for this type of product is pretty thin at the moment and the WSJ could only find two firms exploring them. Crypto hedge fund Cipher Technologies is one such firm which began offering structured products on BTC earlier this year. However, founder and managing partner, Gerald Banks, told the outlet: “We would not fathom pushing this to anyone who would not be fully versed in the risk or in the nature of the underlying asset,” A reverse convertible is one of the products on the table. In this instance, the client loans money to the firm in return for monthly interest payments and loan payment in full once the contract expires. However, if Bitcoin price falls below a predetermined level, which it did earlier this year, Cipher returns the principal minus the amount BTC has lost. GSR, another crypto firm led by former Goldman Sachs commodities traders, has unveiled various products this year. Some of them include binary options which pay on price direction and variance swaps which payout based on Bitcoin price volatility. Former SEC economist Craig McCann thinks these so-called “investment products” are a bad idea. According to him ‘there are all kinds of problems associated with any structured product tied to Bitcoin.’ At the moment these niche products are yet to attract wider interest, but this was also the case when CBOE and CME launched their futures in December 2017. What it does show is that the space has matured enough over the past couple years to even get complex Bitcoin derivatives on the table. Is there a viable market for such investment products?

In a recently published op-ed, Bloomberg contributor Leonid Bershidsky advised investors to ignore Bitcoin’s quick ascension to $5,000 as the move was nothing more than a “blip” driven by manipulation. Throughout the article, Bershidsky questioned the logic of investors optimistically viewing “Bitcoin as a better safe haven than other, more traditional investments” which provide more reliable returns and he advised investors to steer clear of cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, this guidance relies on more misconceptions than truth.  Admittedly, last year’s cryptocurrency price action was far from stellar, but viewing 2018 in isolation fails to incorporate Bitcoin’s performance since inception and this stunted view also ignores the technological strides blockchain and the Bitcoin network have accrued over time. The premise that cryptocurrency investors are essentially putting their money into a slot machine is flawed and while most people will agree that Bitcoin is an extremely volatile asset, conventional portfolio building strategy calls for representation of high growth assets. Since the end of 2017s monster rally a number of financial analysts have suggested that a 1 to 2 percent digital asset allocation should be part of every well-diversified portfolio and considering Bitcoin’s current performance this appears to be sound advice.  As the chart below shows, the first half of 2019 provided great returns for stock investors and at the moment Bitcoin is strongly outperforming each of these markets.   Bitcoin vs. Major Markets: Source: YCharts Bitcoin’s rise from $3,200 to $5,000 meant it was time for investors to begin paying closer attention to the cryptocurrency market and investors who followed Bershidsky’s advice in April have now missed out on a 180% gain.     According to Bershidsky:  There has been no good news about cryptocurrencies lately — they aren’t acquiring greater acceptance as investments or payments, and the crypto experiments of central banks, governments, and major companies haven’t moved beyond dabbling. Again, there are numerous inaccuracies within this statement. In reality, the cryptocurrency market is booming and in more ways than one. Venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, financial institutions and numerous governments took note of Bitcoin’s 2017 performance and in 2019 the cryptocurrency market is backed by more than just speculative retail investors.  Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs, TD Ameritrade, and the Intercontinental Exchange are just a few of the larger players that have expressed deep interest in Bitcoin investment. Contrary to Bershidsky’s statement, the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem has evolved and also begun to penetrate other sectors.  In fact, less than two weeks ago MetLife announced that it would use Ethereum blockchain to streamline the processing of life insurance claims and StateFarm and USAA are reported to be following suit. Mastercard, Visa, Bank of America, and a growing list of companies are regularly filing blockchain-related patents and hiring blockchain developers at an increasing rate. The mass adoption of blockchain by these massive insurance and banking corporations is no laughing matter as life insurance is currently a $2.7 trillion dollar industry. Further proof of the sector’s diversification and expansion comes from the rapid growth in the industry surrounding peer-to-peer and institutional-level crypto lending. This multi-billion dollar industry has blossomed to the extent that there are now a number of companies which allow cryptocurrency holders to securely stake and lend their digital assets for an attractive return.  Therefore the one-sided view that cryptocurrency investing is nothing more than gambling is quickly approaching obsolescence. Today investors have a range of crypto-investment options to choose from and it is much easier to align one’s selection with their appetite for risk.  There’s been bad news, though — more big hacks, more dying currencies, more pump-and-dump schemes (sometimes, the extinctions and the schemes go together). -Leonid Bershidsky Obsession over the threat of manipulation, hacks, scams, drugs, dark markets, terrorism, and other illegal activities are another frequent set of critiques no-coiners and crypto skeptics often present when lambasting cryptocurrency. While manipulation, hacks, scams and, ransomware does pose a credible threat to portions of the sector, research has shown that less than one percent of Bitcoin is used for the aforementioned illicit activities.  The oft-referenced possibility of the Bitcoin network becoming centralized and susceptible to a 51% attack is also baseless. In reality, the Bitcoin network is stronger than ever and on June 21 the hash rate notched a new all-time high above 65,000,000 TH/s. This means it would take an immense amount of computing power to compromise the network and the fact that other fundamentals like block size and daily on-chain transaction volume are on the rise are all proof that a growing number of people are using Bitcoin. Bitcoin Network Hash Rate: Source: Blockchain.com Critics unwavering concern with hacks and scams are partially sourced from the trauma some investors publicly endured as the initial coin offering (ICO) era of 2016-2017 imploded and many projects and investment schemes were exposed as nothing more than get rich quick schemes.   Looking to the present, these issues have been addressed and thanks to the ingenuity of large cryptocurrency exchanges, entrepreneurs, and blockchain startups can now safely raise funds through initial exchange offerings (IEOs). Major exchanges like Kraken and Binance have also addressed the threat of hacks by integrating stringent security features to protect users funds.  Kraken upped the ante by providing increased transparency into its reserves through a Proof-of-Reserves audit which is carried out by an independent auditor. Meanwhile, Binance protects investors with its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU). Recently the fund was put to the test when Binance underwent a $40 million hack in May and not a single investor lost money.  Simply put, major players in the sector have worked hard to address the weaknesses that undermined the sector’s credibility and the current state of the market does not align with the dystopian vision that crypto-skeptics frequently project onto the sector.  A simple investing idiom that many traders throw about is ‘don’t trade against the trend’, especially if it’s pronouncedly bullish. Bitcoin’s recent performance should perk up the ears of any sensible investor and while attempting to counter trade such a strongly established trend is questionable, completely ignoring it is nothing short of foolish. As Bitcoin repeatedly cascaded to new lows in 2018, smart money quietly began to accumulate Bitcoin and institutional demand for the digital asset has steadily risen since November 2018.  Proof of this comes as recently as June 17 when open interest for Bitcoin contracts at CME Group eclipsed the volume seen during the peak of the 2017 crypto bull market to reach 5,311 contracts totaling 26,555 Bitcoin (roughly $246 million). At the moment the general consensus is that institutions and Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event are fuelling the current rally.  CME BTC Futures Open Interest: Source: CME Group Twitter From a bird’s eye view, the cryptocurrency sector is clearly vibrant and expanding. Crypto-payments and peer to peer transactions are gaining traction across the globe and Bitcoin is fast becoming the preferred store of value and exchangeable currency in economic and politically volatile countries like Iran, Venezuela, Argentina, and Turkey.  At the same time, investors in democratic countries with stable economies now have more credible, regulated options for investing in cryptocurrency and as discussed in this article, investment is merely one component of what has now become a multifaceted sector.  Cryptocurrency is bigger than investing and it’s bigger than just Bitcoin. The narrative that cryptocurrency has no future other than speculation is utterly false and the failure to adopt a long view of the sector’s growth potential means investors and businesses are leaving money on the table.

But now, traditional banking is increasingly under threat from geopolitical uncertainty and, most significantly, from the advent of new technologies, including artificial intelligence and Bitcoin. As a result, behemoths like Deutsche Bank are now undergoing efforts to radically transform their business model.  New technologies, may have already profoundly disrupted existing banking and financial systems. Some banks are taking drastic steps to ensure that they survive by trying to catch up on innovation. The most recent example comes from Deutsche Bank. Its management is aware that “Digital is on the rise. No getting away from it.” Thus, on July 7, 2019, Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing admitted that 150 years after its founding, the bank now has to be rebuilt in order to survive. Sewing stated, “The rebuilding will, however, only be successful if we fundamentally reshape our infrastructure – all of the cross-divisional functions supporting the businesses.” To achieve this transformation, among other things, Deutsche Bank plans to invest 13 billion euros in technology by 2022, while cutting 18,000 jobs. Banks have always faced risks, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Problems can also be triggered if a bank faces too many liabilities and lacks enough cash to satisfy those liabilities when they come due, etc. Moreover, geopolitical uncertainties can also trigger an enormous financial crisis. Deutsche Bank estimates that the impact of the U.S.-China trade wars has already obliterated over USD 5 trillion from the financial market. Usually, governments have been willing to rescue banks during the crisis, especially if they were big. The “too big to fail” systematic policy was highlighted during the 2008 financial crisis. But now, perhaps, the biggest threat to the banking industry is posed by the fact that your Bitcoin wallet is your bank. In this regard, Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, has already sounded the alarm. In April 2019, Lagarde told CNBC that cryptocurrencies and financial technology developments are “clearly shaking” the banking system. And, she added, “We do not want innovation that would shake the system so much that we would lose the stability that is needed.” Lagarde will continue to have a position of leadership in the world banking system. As reported by Bitcoinist, She has just been nominated as the new president of the European Central Bank. Most likely, many other banks will start reengineering their processes and reducing their large workforces, as Deutsche Bank is doing. However, unlike during other financial or banking crises, this time, Bitcoin is around to deftly handle the ensuing global economic slowdown. Moreover, folks who have been shown pink slips in the traditional financial services industry will find an opportunity to start again with jobs paying in BTC, which they can hold as a real robust store of value and also use for payments. How do you think Bitcoin technology will continue to disrupt the traditional banking system?

Price action is squeezing, resulting in the range becoming tighter as market price nears the end of the triangle. A clear breakout or breakdown will present a great trade opportunity in the coming days.   On the 4 Hour chart, we can see an asymmetrical triangle has formed as a result of the most recent pull-back to $9,600 from the yearly high around $13,900. Price action range is becoming increasingly narrower as price levels near towards the end of the triangle. This is a strong sign of ”suppression” as trading range begins to tighten, after a large move an explosive move must happen thereafter. The same concept can be applied to a spring, in the same way when a spring or coil is suppressed it will eventually spring back open. This concept is commonly seen with the indicator ”Bollinger Bands”. The best way to approach trading Bitcoin over the coming days is to assume a break to the upside or downside of the highlighted triangle will result in further movement in that direction, this presents a great risk/reward breakout trade opportunity. Key levels to look out for if price levels break to the downside are $9,700, $9,300, $8,900 and $8,300. Current market price sits directly on the 50MA for the 4 Hour timeframe, this is commonly seen on the weekends as volume drops and market price returns to a common median, which in this case is the 50MA at $11,300 which also so happens to be the 4 Hour POC (Point of Control). This again backs up my thesis of an explosive move coming over the coming days as price levels appear to be suppressed.  On the 30 Minute, we can see how price action is unfolding within the asymmetrical triangle. There’s been numerous tests of both overhead resistance and ascending support over the last 7 Days, really beginning to show the strength of this trading pattern. Over the last 48 Hours, we can see another small uptrend has formed within the triangle, I will be using this uptrend to gauge whether price action will likely re-test support around $11,000 first or resistance around $11,650. Whichever way price action decides to break I will be entering into the corresponding position (short/long). It’s likely we will see the triangle continue to play out well into this coming week, resulting in price action range becoming tighter and tighter. Many traders will get caught up within the trading range hoping for a trade opportunity whilst completely missing the clear asymmetrical triangle on the hourly timeframes. We will know by July 12th where BTC plans to head and how best to approach your entries/exits. You can check out my previous analysis on BTC from just a few days ago to see how price action has developed this week. Do you think BTC price will break up or down in the coming days?

But who are this week’s winners and losers in the world of BTC and cryptocurrency? Let’s go through it all in the Bitcoin news weekly recap. Bitcoin price ended last week with a melancholic mood, and that continued to be felt throughout the past seven days. The start of the week saw the price correction deepen, as bearish signals were flashing all over the weekly close. At the same time, Bitcoin price allegedly hit $76k on LocalBitcoins in Zimbabwe, as the government banned all foreign currency. The disparity in sentiment continued; as price dipped briefly back down into four figures, the CSO of Binance was predicting a rally to $100k. Thankfully that dip didn’t last long, and Bitcoin price seemed to find a floor at $10k. In fact, we wondered if this might be the last opportunity to ever buy Bitcoin for less than $10,000. Sure enough, we saw a rally back towards $12,000, only to be cut off at the pass. For the second half of the week, the price stayed in the $11,000 range, consolidating for perhaps another big push. Certainly that is the view of many. Pundits are making bold predictions for bitcoin price by the end of 2019. The S&P 500 hitting all-time highs raised the question over whether Bitcoin will follow suit. And network fundamentals would seem to suggest a significant new breakout is imminent. Those patiently waiting for the recent Bitcoin price rally to kick off alt-season are still waiting, albeit perhaps slightly less patiently. Rather than spurring price movement in altcoins, Bitcoin’s recent rally has instead seen its dominance and market share increase. Some were predicting that today’s radically different cryptocurrency market may mean that alt-season never comes again. Blockstream has had a busy week, debuting both atomic swaps and lightning network payments on its Liquid side-chain. Mining rig manufacturer, Bitmain is allegedly resurrecting its planned IPO, this time in the US. There were claims that Bitfinex’s LEO token is open to massive fraud. And China fell in love with Bitcoin again, or at least its media did. The crypto-world leaped on gold-bug, Peter Schiff’s admission that he does actually own some Bitcoin, with cries of ‘hypocrite’ being the favored response. However, those hoping that Schiff had changed his stance were to be disappointed. He still thinks Bitcoin has an underlying value of zero. It didn’t stop him encouraging people to send him free Bitcoin though, and he now hopes to collect one full Bitcoin through the kind donations of the crypto community. How do you think Bitcoin fared this week? Let us know in the comment section below!

Posting on the Bitcoin subreddit, “Boredguy32” revealed that the controversial organization may have amassed about 4,054 BTC. Based on the current spot price, this cache would be worth about $46.2 million. According to the Redditor, the organization switched wallets in 2018 but an analysis of both wallets gives a complete picture of how much BTC WikiLeaks acquired over the years.  A significant portion of this BTC sum might have come from donations sent in from people wishing to support WikiLeaks in exposing government secrets. As reported by Bitcoinist back in 2016, the total value of all BTC donations received by WikiLeaks stood at $22 million. When authorities finally arrested its founder Julian Assange, the defense fund set up saw almost $30,000 in donations within a few short weeks. Whether the company still possesses a significant portion of the $46 million isn’t known. Given the nature of WikiLeaks’ operations, there might have been considerable outflows too cover legal fees and to support the modalities required for exposing secret information. It is also possible that WikiLeaks moved a portion of the funds received into unknown wallet addresses. With the price of BTC expected to go as high as anywhere between $28,000 and $55,000 by 2020, the organization might be sitting on a fortune. If WikiLeaks has indeed sold all its Bitcoin, then it would reminiscent of Laszlo Hanyecz and the 10,000 BTC payment for a couple of pizzas. WikiLeaks reportedly created its first BTC wallet back in mid-June 2011, putting firmly in the class of early adopters. However, the organization might have started using BTC a lot earlier than that.  Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown Bitcoin creator posting on the Bitcointalk forum in late 2010 said: I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.  Perhaps thankfully, Julian Assange heeded Nakamoto’s words and didn’t bring WikiLeaks’ heat onto a still infant Bitcoin. Little known fact, the above quote from Nakamoto is one of the last ever entries on the Bitcointalk forum before he/she vanished with hardly a trace.

In the meantime, members of the U.S. Congress fear that the U.S. is falling behind other nations in the crypto industry. This fear is prompting them to consider bills to clarify legal issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and thus propel the development of the crypto industry. Under pressure from lawmakers, the IRS is expected to update its 2014 guidance on cryptocurrencies within the next few weeks, according to the WSJ. Presently, the IRS refers to Bitcoin and other crypto assets as “virtual currencies.” And it considers them to be an asset or property. According to the IRS Notice 2014-21, Bitcoin is a convertible virtual currency. However, contrary to real currencies, virtual currencies have no legal tender status. This is about to change, depending on how the IRS updates its Bitcoin-related guidance. In a letter addressed to Rep. Tom Emmer (R., Minn.) the IRS indicated that the guidance update, “would address methods for calculating taxes ‘and other’ issues,” the WSJ reports. The U.S. is lagging behind in the global crypto industry race, as regulatory burdens and the lack of legal clarity are stifling innovation. As a result, some U.S. lawmakers are getting worried and pushing for legislation that would stimulate the growth of the crypto industry. These lawmakers are aware that other countries are ahead of the U.S in the industry. For example, Japan and Switzerland already have in place regulatory frameworks to attract new projects and investments. Thus, Facebook preferred to incorporate the Libra group in Switzerland instead of the U.S. Bitcoin supporters expect that U.S. legislation will avoid classifying cryptocurrencies as securities in order to facilitate the advancement of Bitcoin-friendly rules. In effect, in April 2019, the 116th Congress (2019-2020) introduced The Token Taxonomy Act of 2019 that would require the SEC to amend the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to exclude crypto assets from the definition of a security. The change of the definition is a prerequisite, “To adjust taxation of virtual currencies held in individual retirement accounts, to create a tax exemption for exchanges of one virtual currency for another, to create a de minimis exemption from taxation for gains realized from the sale or exchange.” The IRS defines a de minimis as follows: “In general, a de minimis benefit is one for which, considering its value and the frequency with which it is provided, is so small as to make accounting for it unreasonable or impractical.” Additionally, Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.), members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, and Science, and Transportation introduced the Blockchain Promotion Act of 2019, on February 26, 2019. One of the purposes of the Blockchain Promotion Act is to exempt nonfinancial businesses using blockchain from being classified as money transmitters. The Blockchain Promotion Act would also direct the Secretary of Commerce to set up a working group to study blockchain technology and subsequently determine a consensus-based definition of blockchain technology. At the introduction of the Bill, Senator Young said, “Blockchain has the potential to be a catalyst for sustained economic growth across all industries in America. If America leads in its development, we can ensure that its benefits will be shared far and wide. Blockchain has the potential to not only provide financial and economic benefits at home, but humanitarian and social support in developing countries will benefit from American leadership.” How do you think the IRS guidance update, the Token Taxonomy Act of 2019, and the Blockchain Promotion Act will impact Bitcoin’s value?

Since dropping from its rising channel on June 26th Litecoin has mirrored Bitcoin’s volatility and is currently consolidating on the 4-hour and daily time frame. The altcoin recovered nicely from its swing low near $111 and after topping out at $127.83 on July 4th LTC’s price is tightening within a symmetrical triangle.  Since Saturday the altcoin has struggled to trade above the 12 and 26 exponential moving average (EMA) but the fact that the upper and lower arm of the Bollinger Band indicator is tightening and LTC slowly approaches the 20-MA of the indicator suggests that a decisive move is imminent.   At the time of writing the MACD is on the verge of a bullish cross and trading volume is tightening as the RSI climbs near 50.  In the event of an upside break, LTC needs to cross above the 50% Fib retracement level and close above $126 on the daily chart. While anything under $137 is a lower high, a rally to $135 would restore LTC to the ascending channel which the altcoin had traded in since April 30.  There’s also the remote chance of a daily trend change on the LTC BTC pairing and the 4hr chart shows consolidation which is similar to that of the LTC-USD paring. Any bullish trend change from an altcoin – BTC pairing is worth investigation given that Bitcoin’s growing dominance throughout the recent rally to $13,800 has taken a toll on most Alts.  A move to and above 0.010912 is significant and similar to the USD pairing, the MACD appears on the verge of a bullish cross on the 4-hour chart. Gains above 0.010912 would also set a higher low on the daily chart for the first time in nearly a week and this could excite traders as anticipation of Litecoin’s upcoming halving event has crypto-investors wondering whether another rally is in store.  Ultimately, the next 24-48 hours will be important as LTC approaches the tip of the symmetrical triangle. Traders should watch to see if the 12 and 26 EMA’s converge and cross above the mid-arm of the Bollinger Band indicator. Keeping an eye on volume should also provide valuable insight as volume tends to precede price.  Happy trades friends!  Do you think LTC will overtake $125 – $135 in the next 24 to 48-hours?

With the Bitcoin block reward halving less than a year away, the network activity parameters continue to set new ATHs. Data from Blockchain.com shows that metrics like hash rate, difficulty, blockchain size, and unspent transaction (UTXO) count are all at their highest ever levels. As at press time, the network hash rate is 74.5 quintillion hashes per second (74.5 million tera hashes per second — TH/s). This figure represents an almost 140% increase in the amount of computing power used to secure the network since the late 2018 plunge.  At that time, there were fears of a mining death spiral, as many nodes exited the network due to declining mining profitability occasioned by the 80% drop in BTC price. Fast-forward half a year later and the situation is the complete opposite. These massive improvements in the network fundamentals have seen an influx of investment into the mining arena. Earlier in July, Northern Bitcoin — a German-based crypto mining company announced that it would be purchasing 5,000 ASICs from Canaan Creative and Bitmain. There is a lot of speculation about the possibility of a new price ATH even before the 2020 block reward halving. Bitcoin is presently accumulating around the $11,000 price mark, a 120% increase since the start of the year. Crypto trader Craig Cobb of Tradercobb.com predicts will set a new ATH of $27,200. Cobb, however, says bitcoin might see a drop below $9,000 before shooting for a new high above $20,000. The top-ranked cryptocurrency has seen a few 20 to 30% declines during its 2019 run so far. For Cobb, each pullback only brings BTC back to the “cradle zone” (the price action area within the 10 to 20 period moving average). As for what happens post-halving, history might provide some insight. After the 2016 block reward halving, the price of BTC increased by more than 900%. This run culminated in mid-December 2017 when bitcoin almost topped $20,000 Price analysis like the stock to flow, model, predict a BTC price of $55,000 by the 2020 halving. A 10x advance like in 2016 would put bitcoin at over $500,000 by the end of 2021. This run, while spectacular might not be enough to save John McAfee and his “jewels.” By how much do you expect the price of Bitcoin to increase after the 2020 halving event?

In his latest podcast he explained that he regrets not buying BTC when he first heard of it, and why this doesn’t make him a hypocrite. Since Schiff’s Bitcoin ownership became public, he has faced a barrage of criticism for being a hypocrite. Well don’t worry Peter, that’s not going to happen here. Addressing the criticism, Schiff explained that he regrets not buying Bitcoin at under $100 when he first heard of it. However, he pointed out that he would be a fool not to regret that. After all, he could have made a lot of money if he had bought Bitcoin then. He also suggested that notorious Bitcoin-skeptics like Warren Buffett and Nouriel Roubini, probably also regret not buying Bitcoin at sub-$100. Again, they could have made a lot of money if they had. But if he had bought Bitcoin back then, he says he was unlikely to still be HODLing it, as he would likely have sold it for a profit at some point. Discussing his Bitcoin ownership, Schiff revealed that he had received that initial amount from ShapeShift CEO, Erik Voorhees. Following a debate, the pair went out for dinner, and Voorhees took Schiff’s cellphone, installed a wallet and transferred him $100 of Bitcoin. Schiff transferred $50 back and kept $50. This dropped in value and then rallied to the $100 that he admitted to owning. The interaction did impress Schiff with the ease and speed at which Bitcoin can be sent. He explained: I think it is kinda cool that you can send it very quickly. I’ve always admitted that that is one of the good features of Bitcoin. Following his ‘outing’ by Anthony Pompliano, along with the offer of another $100 of Bitcoin if he provided his wallet address, Schiff says that he has now collected £2140 worth. This has been donated in small value transactions by many in the bitcoin community. Interestingly, at the time of recording the podcast, Pompliano had not sent his offered $100, as the donations had all been for smaller amounts. Those hoping that bitcoin ownership will convert Schiff into a Bitcoin fan, are likely to be disappointed. He still believes that the underlying value of the Bitcoin is zero, and he does not intend to buy any for himself. However, he does encourage people to send him more free Bitcoin and wondered if he could collect a whole one. Out of respect for the people who have sent him the Bitcoin, Schiff intends to HODL it, so that his supporters can track its value. If the Bitcoin he has been donated doesn’t convert Schiff himself, perhaps some of his followers may take an interest as the price begins to rise.

While this debate is bound to continue, the S&P 500 recently reached a new all-time high and analysts are now wondering whether Bitcoin will follow suit.  On July 5th crypto analyst Alessio Rastani pointed out that the S&P 500 recently notched a new all-time high and Rastani expects the index will pull back slightly below 2950 before rebounding significantly higher above 3000.  In order for this scenario to play out, the S&P 500 needs to remain above the 2950 – 2930 support.  As the stock market rallies to successive all-time highs, Bitcoin price continues to march upward and the digital asset has successfully remained above the 21 daily moving average (DMA). Rastani pointed out that since February 2019, Bitcoin price has bounced off the 21 DMA 7 times.  Bitcoin price-USD daily chart from Alessio Rastani’s YouTube channel This useful tidbit of knowledge will allow more relaxed traders to stay in their long positions by just observing Bitcoin’s price action on the daily chart and over the short-term traders could remain calm until Bitcoin price drops and closes below the 21 DMA which would be a strong bearish signal.  Popular crypto analyst Josh Rager also makes a similar case in which Bitcoin price could see a bullish continuation on toward the recent 2019 all-time high if it successfully closes above $11,967.  Rager also highlights the potential bearish scenario by pointing out that recently Bitcoin has made lower highs and lower lows and failure to close above $11,967 could lead to a new lower low in the $9,100 region.   Fortunately, Rager is on the side of bulls and believes that the bullish outcome is more likely than the aforementioned bearish scenario.   Rager suggests that the most ideal scenario would be for Bitcoin price to “create a new higher-high and then break the $12,300 daily resistance followed by a retest of the yearly high at $13,800+.”  At the time of writing, Bitcoin has pulled back slightly from $11,640 to trade near $11,400. The MACD on the 4-hour BTC-USD chart is on the verge of a bullish cross and the RSI is slowly climbing above 51. The recent strong 4-hour close also brought BTC above the mid-arm of the Bollinger Band indicator but an increase in buy volume is required in order for Bitcoin to cross above $12,000.

The Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange pitted Bitcoin against thirty alternative cryptocurrencies to determine whether or not it moved in lockstep with them. The exchange noted that all the known altcoins were tailing the Bitcoin price trend positively in Q2/2019. Nevertheless, the speed at which they followed the leading cryptocurrency experienced a drop, implying that the altcoin market, as a whole, failed to run along with a supercharged Bitcoin price rally. “Bitcoin (BTC) became less correlated with other crypto assets in Q2 2019 relative to the first three months of 2019,” read Binance. “Correlations declined between Bitcoin and altcoins, with a decrease in the average correlation of -0.11.” In retrospective, a perfect positive correlation between two assets reflects their 100% probability of moving in the same direction. Conversely, a negative one means that the two would always run in the opposite direction. Assets with a correlation score above 0.5 show positive correlations between the two, while a score below -0.5 exhibits negative associations. Bitcoin Dips against Altcoins in Terms of Correlation | Image Credits: Binance Research Binance noted that Ethereum came closest to Bitcoin with a 0.81 positive correlation in Q2/2019, down from 0.889 of the previous quarter. Similarly, the XRP-to-Bitcoin correlation dropped from 0.875 in Q2/2019 to 0.69 in Q1/2019. The statistics appeared the same across the rest of the cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin, MIOTA, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, and others. The said dip appeared in line with the Bitcoin’s growing dominance in the cryptocurrency market. The leading cryptocurrency mousetrapped more than 63 percent of the total market valuation, leaving other digital assets with a fractional influence. Binance called it a “flight-to-quality behavior,” a term which indicates investors’ partiality towards what they believe is the most bullish asset. Excerpts from the report: “The overall market capitalization rose by 139%, whereas altcoin aggregated market capitalization (including stablecoins) increased by “just” 71 percent over the same period. This can likely be attributed to a “flight-to-quality” behavior by crypto investors in an early bull-market state.” The statistics closely followed the findings of Gabor Gurbacs of VanEck. The digital asset director noted that Bitcoin had left all the blue chips (a basket of top ten cryptocurrencies) and smaller cap coins (another pool of top 100 cryptocurrencies) behind in the previous 12 months in terms of returns, as shown in his tweet below: 2/2 Over the past 1 year, #Bitcoin left both blue chips and small caps in the dust within the digital asset space. + Bitcoin ($MVBTC:) +71.5%+ Blue Chips ($MVDA10): -6.5%+ Small Caps ($MVDASC): -64.6%Data: @MVISIndices,@CryptoCompare pic.twitter.com/BANNX72n9r — Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) July 3, 2019  Although the Blue Chips (Ticker: MVDA10) recorded a lesser loss compared to the Small Caps (Ticker: MVDASC), a closer look reveals that Bitcoin had more than 33 percent dominance in the former. The Binance report reflected a shift in crypto investors’ mindset. They considered Bitcoin safer than most of the alternatives available inside — and also outside — the cryptocurrency industry. “The report could help in assessing whether today’s crypto-market environment behaves similarly to historical early stages of bullish environments in traditional financial markets,” Binance concluded.

According to unnamed sources speaking to Chinese-language news outlet, Jiemian, Bitmain finished the signing late last month. This comes only 4 months after Bitmain’s proposed Hong Kong exchange IPO application lapsed.  “Bitmain previously only gave options to core development staff and those who joined before October 2015,” a rough translation of the sources’ comments reads. This time, anyone who joined before 2018 and who have certain positions will get options… almost all of them. The news comes in tandem with a reversal in fortunes for Bitmain, as with other mining companies, as the 2019 Bitcoin bull market transforms mining potential. The company has allegedly already plugged the gap in funding triggered by the 2018 bear market, according to the sources. Bitmain did not respond to a confirmation request from Jiemian, but was already the subject of fresh IPO speculation after mainstream media reports surfaced several weeks ago. As Bitcoinist reported, at the time, sources quoted a target figure of $500 million for the sale. “[Bitmain] is working with advisers on preparations for a U.S. share sale that could take place as soon as the second half of this year,” Bloomberg reported quoting more anonymous sources. “Bitmain aims to file listing documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as next month” The reemergence reflects the overall optimism which has returned to the Bitcoin mining market since the beginning of the upturn in April. Other companies have reported expansion plans and better-than-expected financial performances, with the remainder of the year set to see the creation of new eco-friendly mining farms.  Last month, a report highlighted the continued investment piling into mining in a bid to transform its profitability. Energy management was key, the figures noting around 74 percent of power used in the industry came from renewable sources.  Bitmain had previously issued warnings about both profits and viability. At the end of 2018, when Bitcoin traded around $3500, the company began closing operations in locations such as Israel, as well as laying off staff.  A senior management reshuffle followed, which reportedly saw former CEO Jihan Wu transfer to a less managerial role, something the Jiemian sources also appeared to confirm.  “Although Wu Jihan is a director, he has no voting rights on the board of directors,” they said.    What do you think about the Bitmain reports?

Trade Wars', '3. The Bitcoin Halvening in 2020', '4. Bitcoin Is Becoming a Risk-Off Trade', '5. Surging Institutional Trading Volume', '6. Mainstream Markets Bigger Than Ever', '7. Rise in Socialism']","  Christina Comben | Jul 05, 2019 | 10:00 With BTC price consolidating, the brakes on this current bull run seem to be on. But that can only be a temporary stop. With global conditions fuelling the need for an alternative financial system, the next Bitcoin bull run will be epic.  Co-founder of Interchange, Dan Hedl put out an interesting tweet in which stated that the next Bitcoin bull run will be “massive” due to at least seven major factors, including geopolitical forces creating the perfect storm for Bitcoin. Let’s break down each one. $10 trillion may be a conservative estimate. Bitcoinist reported earlier this week that global government debts with negative yields have now gone beyond $13 trillion.  More than 40% of global bonds now fail to offer the holder any profit. In fact, if the holder of the bonds keeps on to them past the maturity date, they’ll actually receive less than they put in. This is something that has no precedent in financial history and shows that the monetary policy of many central banks is out of control. When investors can no longer reap returns from the bond market, they’ll need to look elsewhere to make gains. The US-China trade war has seen global stock markets plunge. While there have been talks between both countries to reach an agreement, Bloomberg Markets are predicting that the truce may be temporary with another trade war coming in the fall.  If the U.S. pushes too high with trade tariffs, that could cause a tailspin for the Chinese Yuan, pushing investors and savvy business owners into a safe-haven asset, whether it’s gold or Bitcoin. Going by the performance of the latter, that’s where the smart money would be. The halvening event that happens after the mining of every 210,000 blocks is meant to deter inflation in Bitcoin’s price. Instead of printing money as central banks do, Bitcoin actively reduces the rewards for miners by half.  After the two past halvening events in 2012 and 2016, Bitcoin price went parabolic. With the next halvening on the horizon next year, and the myriad of factors that weren’t present during the last one, the next Bitcoin bull run will epic. Investors will leave one asset class for another according to the level of perceived risk. Oftentimes, they will take a break from the stock market in times of economic downturn and place their money in bonds instead.  But as we’ve seen from the dire state of global bonds, their alternatives are becoming scant. Bitcoin is starting to be perceived by real heavy-weight investors as a “risk-off” trade as stocks and bonds go haywire.  The rise in institutional trading will be a massive factor in the next Bitcoin bull run. Just a few days ago, Bitcoin was trading at a huge 40% premium on Grayscale, indicating that bigger money is coming in.  With ICE markets, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, and other major institutions on board, so far, this latest bull run is completely different from 2017. Retail investors aren’t in yet. All the price action is coming from serious money that will give Bitcoin another massive boost. There’s now far greater awareness of Bitcoin than there was two years ago, even if the majority of the population still doesn’t understand it or even use it.  More places accept payment in Bitcoin, more companies are building on the blockchain and corporations like Facebook on the edge of taking cryptocurrency to the masses.  Mainstream markets are at an all-time high. That means that when the next Bitcoin bull run takes hold in earnest, it will be unstoppable. With more socialist movements rearing their heads around the world, this could fuel the next Bitcoin bull run. People are rejecting authoritarian governments and finding a way to circumvent their rigid monetary policies.  This has already been evidenced in countries like Iran and Turkey where a government devaluing their currency at will is pushing people to Bitcoin.  There’s no doubt about it, the next Bitcoin bull run is going to be massive. The planets are aligning to take the world’s first cryptocurrency to the moon. What do you think of these 7 factors? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!

Speaking on an episode of the Coinist Podcast on July 4, Woo, who is a well-known analyst of the Bitcoin blockchain with several dedicated resources, stuck by his predictions for the cryptocurrency’s near-term future.  In 2013, Woo predicted Bitcoin’s market cap would hit the trillion dollar mark by 2025. Since then, the price has fallen as low as $200 and climbed as high as $20,000.  At press time Friday, Bitcoin’s market cap was $195 million, or 62.1% of the cryptocurrency total. He summarized, I think this cycle will get us past the trillion dollar cycle, and then the next cycle will be the one that takes us to breaking the gold market cap,   Woo was speaking as BTC/USD hovered around $11,700 before a slight downturn took markets back below $10,800. Despite its successful year, Bitcoin continues to see criticism from proponents of assets such as gold, who argue its utility will never match the precious metal.  Peter Schiff, the veteran gold bug with a particular distaste for Bitcoin, even predicted its downfall would come as a result of government shutdowns.  Schiff is currently the subject of a lobbying effort from Bitcoin users, who have sent him $1500 in donations in an attempt to change his mind.  For Woo, however, gold merely forms one hurdle in a much longer timeline for Bitcoin’s development. For him, BTC represents the world’s first “internet-native digital currency.” “Bankers say it’s a bubble, technologists call it a disruption; students of history would call it the dawn of the digital age,” he concluded.  Woo is far from alone in his positivity. By 2023, others see Bitcoin rising to as high as $1 million, including the infamous prediction coming from John McAfee who has promised to eat his male appendage if he turns out to be wrong.  Meanwhile, short-term projections, specifically the Mayer Multiple, see the next few months being cooler for BTC/USD. As Bitcoinist reported, the metric suggested last month that in September, Bitcoin would cost around $15,000, but that this would be “overvalued.” By the end of the year, however, this would change to $21,000 – higher than ever before – which would nonetheless represent a “fair value.” Another source last week claimed real public interest in Bitcoin would kick in only when such levels appeared.

There are those that clearly detest it, most of whom do not understand the technology and those that fully advocate a world with decentralized peer-to-peer money. Peter Schiff is firmly in the former camp but has actually admitted to owning some BTC, in a recent tweet. Co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, Anthony Pompliano, made the revelation in a tweet yesterday. The vocal Bitcoin hater @PeterSchiff recently admitted that he actually does own some Bitcoin. Never listen to what they say, always watch what they do with their money! The vocal Bitcoin hater @PeterSchiff recently admitted that he actually does own some Bitcoin. Never listen to what they say, always watch what they do with their money! — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 5, 2019  Schiff responded trying to defend his position by stating he only holds $100 worth which was a gift. Pomp couldn’t resist and offered to send a further hundred in BTC, or around 900,000 sats if Peter shared his Bitcoin address, which he duly provided. Schiff may be outspoken when it comes to crypto assets, but he is still a pretty shrewd player. His own company, ShiffGold, accepts payments in BTC and BCH for gold and silver investments. Unlike other serial Bitcoin detractors, such as the rabid ranting Nouriel Roubini, Peter Schiff appears to play his cards close to his chest. In a related story, the gold mogul told RT that Bitcoiners were spreading stories about a golden asteroid in an attempt to devalue the gold markets. It is being floated by the bitcoin community to try to create the false narrative that gold supply is not scarce so the price of gold is going to crash and that people should own bitcoin instead of gold because bitcoin is more scarce, because you’ll never find any bitcoin on the asteroid. The bottom line is both gold and Bitcoin are safer stores of wealth than any fiat currency. This explains their stellar performance recently as more countries seek to manipulate their own currencies exacerbating global economic woes. Just yesterday US president Trump called for dollar devaluation in order to compete with his ‘competitors’ overseas. RT’s Max Keiser has been pretty vocal lately, extolling the virtues of financial sovereignty. You can be individually sovereign with 1M Sats (or less). Whereas someone with $1M (or $1 billion+) and no Sats, is technically still a fiat slave. Poverty is now, for the first time in history, optional.

A recently published press release shows that the London Block Exchange (LBX) and Argento have partnered to develop a zero-fiat bond which is denominated in Bitcoin. The UK and Luxembourg-based companies proudly proclaimed that the product is the first ever Bitcoin Bond in existence and according to Argento manager Phil Millo, “The large investment banks really dropped the ball on this one.”    What makes the bond unique is that it is the first regulated cryptocurrency financial product with a dedicated ISIN code and the bond offers zero fiat exposure to investors. Accessible via the Bloomberg Terminal, the product is specifically targeted toward long investors and LBX CEO Benjamin Davies describes the bond being the most suitable for Bitcoin investors looking to grow their long-term Bitcoin wallets in an institutional grade environment where their holdings are not exposed to traditional currency market fluctuations.  The bond is regulated by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Argento has cleverly titled the various bond durations ‘FOMO’, ‘HODL’, and ‘MOON’, each of which is a standard crypto-oriented acronym commonly used by members of the cryptocurrency community.   Keen investors will note that while the FCA has been stringent in regulated crypto-based financial products and putting a stop to crypto scams, the approval of the zero-fiat bond eclipsed Bakkt’s thrice-delayed debut. Institutional grade crypto-investment products are steadily racking up approvals worldwide as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) continue to drag their feet in approving institutional grade crypto-products like Bakkt’s Bitcoin exchange and the long-awaited Bitcoin-based Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).  Another recent setback to note is Binance’s announcement that US-based users would be barred from using the exchange starting in September as a number of the digital assets listed on the exchange cannot be legally offered to U.S.-based investors. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao explained that the company intends to launch a regulatory-compliant version of  Binance through its partner BAM but exact details of the exchange and its launch date have yet to be released.   Do you think investors will rush into this new zero fiat Bitcoin Bond?

On the calendar, 2019 comes after 2018 but in crypto history, the year will undoubtedly be of far greater significance. Reason? Well, 2018 was something of a long winter for virtual currencies with prices falling by more than 80% across the board. Many commentators had spent 2018 providing extremely positive price predictions on the back of a bullish late 2017 run. Bitcoin fell from $19,800 to $3,100 and altcoins saw red. Perhaps in 2018, people wouldn’t be so eager to offer price forecasts, but alas they were. Not at first though because the Q1 2019 saw not much excitement in the market. When not releasing their pseudo-cryptocurrency, JPMorgan spent Q1 2019 calling BTC at $2,400 fair value and saying the top-ranked crypto was only useful in a dystopia. From a price action perspective, it was dull until April Fool’s day. April 1, 2019, triggers a full-blown rally that sees bitcoin cross $4,000, topping out at $8,000 a month-and-a-half later. Since then, it has been upwards with a few 30% declines along the way, and now BTC is up 220% in the first half of 2019. In Q1 2019, commentators seemed prepared to stick to talking points like fundamentals without giving price forecasts. Since April Fool’s day, however, the price bets have come out in force.  Perennial bitcoin price forecaster Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors has moved from a conservative $10,000 to a more bullish $40,000 forecast in the space of three months. To be fair to Lee, he always did say 2019 would be positive for bitcoin. The Fundstrat chief’s $10,000 prediction came to pass in June 2019. With the $10K mark attained, Lee believes this price milestone will trigger a FOMO-driven hype among retail investors taking BTC to $40,000 before the end of the year. Others like Max Keiser also predicted that bitcoin would hit $10,000 back when the rise above $6,400 was still the 2019 high. Before any of these price calls, however, Weiss Ratings did say BTC would reach a new ATH in 2019. Like Lee, Keiser also upped his short-term price bet from $10,000 to $28,000 at the end of May 2019. Keiser based his forecast on the situation in Europe saying BTC will set a new ATH in 2019. For Keiser, the main goal isn’t even a new ATH but a six-digit price valuation that takes bitcoin’s market capitalization into the trillion-dollar arena on similar levels with commodities like gold. Some commentators also added to the list of future price calls. The stock to flow, price models, predicts a BTC price of $55,000 by 2020. The 2020 halving constitutes an integral part of many of these new future price bets with the expectation of BTC continuing its parabolic advance in the lead up to the block reward halving. As always, there are the naysayers, “bitcoin is going to zero” brigade whose forecasts end up being more laughable than Lee’s $25k end-of-year price call for 2017. JPMorgan says BTC is overpriced, Nouriel Roubini, like a broken record never fails to bring up the $0 prediction. What is your end of year price forecast for Bitcoin?

But that is not deterring investors from making bold bullish predictions for the cryptocurrency. Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, co-founder & partner of Morgan Creek Digital Assets is the latest to join the rank of bulls who believe Bitcoin price could hit the $100,000 level by 2021. The former Facebook executive borrowed his bullish bias from a so-called halving event next May that will slash the supply rate of Bitcoin by half. That would make the cryptocurrency scarcer than it already is. On the other hand, an increase in demand would prompt people to bid for Bitcoin at higher rates. “Supply-Demand economics remain valid,” reasoned Pomp. “They are a great way to determine the market price. So, if the demand for a fixed-supply asset increases, we continue to see price appreciation.” Bitcoin surpassing $10,000 got people talking… Bitcoin hitting $100,000 would get the world talking.@APompliano has a $100K price prediction for 1 BTC by the end of year 2021 🚀 Do you agree? @BloxliveTV clip: https://t.co/gIJEzAloNK pic.twitter.com/94d6peg0z5 — Jessica Walker 🎬🚀 (@Jessicaw_tv) July 4, 2019  Halving has historically done well to Bitcoin. Every four years, the cryptocurrency’s underlying algorithm reduces the supply of Bitcoin by half. In the beginning, the cryptocurrency’s daily issuance rate was close to 7,200 BTC at a block reward of 50 BTC. Following the first halving in 2012, the regular issuance got reduced to approx 3,600 BTC with block reward going down to 25 BTC. And in the next, the numbers got slashed another half —  1,800 BTC daily issuance at a block reward of 12.5 BTC. By May 2020, the block reward will get cut to 6.25 BTC per block while the daily issuance rate would be about 900 BTC. Simultaneously, the price of Bitcoin noted four-digit percentage gains upon every halving event. Following the first supply rate cut, the cryptocurrency noted a 7,976 percent surge in its spot rate. And after the second, it rose by 2,902 percent, as further illustrated in the chart below. Bitcoin Halving Events and Their Impact on Price | Source: Use Journal The all-time highs achieved during each halving also followed more substantial downside corrections. After December 2, 2013, the day Bitcoin established a new historic high of $1,163, the price pursued a strong downtrend, eventually falling by approx 86.90 percent from the local top. Similarly, following the next all-time high formation on December 16, 2017, which was near $19,666, Bitcoin corrected to the downside by approx 83 percent. There were also other catalysts at play during the so-called halving uptrends. In 2013, the Bitcoin price boom came ahead of the hack of Mt. Gox, the largest cryptocurrency exchanges of that time. Willy Report later claimed that shady people in Mt. Gox were artificially inflating the Bitcoin price using bots. “Basically, a random number between 10 and 20 bitcoin would be bought every 5-10 minutes, non-stop, for at least a month on end until the end of January,” read the investigation. The next halving uptrend of 2017 had also experienced shady market behavior. In that, a massive influx of new blockchain startups conducted billions of dollars worth of crowdfunding rounds – all raising funds in Bitcoin. That increased the demand of the cryptocurrency, which sent the price to an unrealistic $20,000 level.  Eventually, more than 90 percent of those startups failed and probably sold their bitcoins to cover their losses. The result was a strong downtrend that brought the cryptocurrency down to as low as $3,122 in December 2018. Bitcoin has outperformed every major and minor asset this year in terms of returns. The world’s first and foremost cryptocurrency in June towered above the $13,500 level, bringing its year-to-date return close to a whopping 275 percent. That happened after major financial firms like TD Ameritrade, Bakkt, and Fidelity Investments announced that they would offer Bitcoin trading services. That said, Bitcoin had every reason to rise based on speculation of real demand, if not real demand itself. But saying it would hit the $100,000 level is nothing but a crystal ball prediction. No evidence shows a broader demand for Bitcoin-related products as of now. And as BitMEX founder Arthus Hayes during the recently-held Asia Blockchain Summit, this cryptocurrency could go anywhere from zero to a million. The question remains: why $100,000?

The trend has remained intact in recent weeks, despite volatility in the Bitcoin price.  At press time, it was smaller-cap tokens which showed the worst performance, trading 54 percent down in the past three months.  That number improves slightly among other indices tracking altcoins with larger market caps, such as the top ten. Overall, Bletchley notes, the top 70 altcoins – selected according to meeting various criteria – has gone from 0.048 BTC to 0.039 BTC since April 1, a shift of 18.75 percent. “There are plenty of people who still think ‘alt season’ is just around the corner, but all eyes are on Bitcoin right now,” crypto journalist and commentator Kyle Torpey wrote in comments on the figures.   As Bitcoinist reported, that idea that the ongoing Bitcoin price rally will ultimately spark a knock-on effect for altcoins is being increasingly called into question.  Unlike in 2017, analysts worry that this time around, Bitcoin is definitively differentiating itself from the rest of the crypto sphere.  According to veteran trading guru Peter Brandt last week, for instance, every token from Ethereum downwards is on the losing end, and only a few will survive the rout.  Brandt likened the current climate to the Dot Com Boom of the early 2000s, noting how a return to form from the initial crash failed to materialize for all but a handful of companies such as Amazon.  Traders should be focused on Bitcoin only at this point, he had said, eyeing a potential trajectory to $100,000. “No other market in my 45 years of trading has gone parabolic on a log chart in this manner. Bitcoin is a market like no other,” he summarized on social media.  Indeed, in terms of attention, Bitcoin will continue to profit more than ever into 2020, thanks to the launch of multiple institutional investor products.  Three of these will be physically-delivered Bitcoin futures, where investors take delivery of Bitcoins, not cash. Bakkt, first of the thre will begin a trial later this month.  Crypto exchange Binance and trading platform ErisX will also follow suit, the latter having received US regulatory permission last week.

This paired with the recent 200EMA / 50MA bullish cross could indicate the start of a new bullish uptrend. $11,300 looks to be a strong support zone around POC (Point of Control) that will dictate the sustainability of this new uptrend.  On the 30 minute chart, we can see the most recent breakout to the upside. This resulted in price levels being propelled above the clear descending channel, as mentioned in a previous analysis. Over the last 24 hours, we’ve seen a small pennant form followed by yet another break to the upside resulting in the market price hitting $12,000 during yesterday’s trading session, on July 3rd. Despite both compelling breakouts volume remains low and steady, this is a very strong sign that a new uptrend could be on the cards. Within the last 3 hours, you can clearly see the 200 EMA and 50 MA have crossed over each other in a bullish fashion. This coupled with the most recent breakouts, plus low and steady volume, really begins to paint a very bullish case for Bitcoin over the next few days/ weeks. Key resistance levels to look out for over the comings weeks are $12,300, $13,800, and $14,500.  The current volume across the total market cap is currently trading well above levels seen during the run-up to $20,000 back in December 2o17 / January 2018. Despite this, the total market cap currently sits around $300B which is less than half the total market cap seen during the aforementioned rally. This leads me to believe it’s only a matter of time until both BTC’s price and the total market cap surpass their ATH’s. Providing volume does continue to grow at the rate we have seen over the last few months, the total market cap all-time high will likely be surpassed before December of 2019. It’s looking increasingly likely that we’ll see parabolic growth for the total market cap across cryptocurrency as institutions such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and major banks begin to explore the possibilities of integrating blockchain solutions into their protocols. Most recently we’ve seen Microsoft add Bitcoin as a payment method in their latest Excel spreadsheet program. Despite concerns and scepticism largely coming from the Crypto community, a big brand such as a Microsoft getting involved in Crypto is a very positive sign of things to come.

Crypto data analytics infrastructure provider, The TIE, have created a “Geographic breakdown of Crypto Twitter” and revealed its findings via the social media platform. 1/ A Geographic Breakdown of Crypto Twitter🌎🌍🌏 Overall 38.9% of total Bitcoin tweets come from the US and 10.5% from the UK. The top five countries where Bitcoin is discussed on Twitter are the US, UK, Canada, Turkey, India, and Australia. pic.twitter.com/vUMG9l4KR2 — The TIE (@TheTIEIO) July 4, 2019  As per The TIE, Bitcoin is discussed on Twitter predominantly in the US, UK, Canada, Turkey, India, and Australia. The US and the UK account for half of the BTC-related tweets, which is quite natural, given that they’re the largest English speaking countries in the world. Moreover, the US has the most Twitter users in general, with the UK coming third, according to April data published on Statista.  The TIE compiled a map that shows the geographical distribution of Bitcoin tweets without considering the US and the UK.    Thus, besides Canada, Turkey, India and Australia, other active countries that discuss Bitcoin include the Netherlands, Japan, France, Germany, Brazil, Nigeria, Russia, South Africa, and Indonesia. What’s even more interesting, The TIE also touched upon the global sentiment around Bitcoin. Thus, the US was recently quite positive, with 61.5% of Bitcoin-related tweets being optimistic. The global percentage of positive BTC tweets is 59.8%. On the other end, Venezuela saw the most negative Bitcoin tweets, with 62%, followed by Mexico, Estonia, Brazil, and Ireland. It’s surprising to see Estonia on the negative side, especially when the Baltic state has been praised for its e-government initiative and even tried to issue a national cryptocurrency. The TIE also created a map showing countries with more positive or more negative Bitcoin tweets.  The analytics platform provider found out that the US residents actually tweeted more about Facebook’s upcoming Libra Coin (43.8%) rather than Bitcoin (39.8%). The UK is also the second on Libra tweets, followed by France, Canada, and Australia. Initially, the conversations around Libra were somewhat positive, though they recently turned negative, especially in the US. As of Wednesday, 54.8% of Libra-related tweets were negative.

The likes of doom monger, Nouriel Roubini, still bash BTC in favor of a largely unprincipled banking system where the top get richer at the expense of the bottom. Banks are far from infallible by nature, and the number of recent reports on money laundering scandals is on the increase. $2 trillion (over ten times the total market capitalization of Bitcoin) is laundered by banks every year and they fear it because a similar public ledger would make them accountable. This was noted by Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiast Rhythmtrader in the below tweet: Banks help launder over $2 trillion every year. That's over 10 times more money than the entire bitcoin network is worth. Why are they then so critical of bitcoin? A public ledger would mean their worst nightmare. Accountability. — Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) July 3, 2019  As millions of Americans celebrate the fourth of July, US president Trump has shown no signs of abating his economic war on the rest of the world. The latest in the Trump twitter tirade has called for mass money manipulation to match what he sees other nations already doing. In the eyes of the POTUS, China and Europe are pumping money into their systems in order to compete with the US. In his view, the US should ‘compete’ by doing exactly the same which would effectively devalue the dollar. Crypto trader Alex Krüger noted that these actions would also increase interest rates and cause stock markets to soar. “China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for many years!” Trump just made an explicit call to manipulate the dollar. He wants lower interest rates, a cheap dollar, and soaring stock markets. https://t.co/DwCx8Xm2Mh — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) July 3, 2019  A weaker dollar would be bullish for Bitcoin as investors seek a safer offshore store of value. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee also noted the need for Trump to crank stock markets higher, which would also be support for equities. It is important to keep in mind the White House wants a rising stock market. This is support for equities. https://t.co/ZU6riFKAL9 — Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) July 3, 2019  Bitcoin has been on fire in recent months, which has also correlated with a falling dollar and an escalating trade war between the US and China. Gold has also reached a six-year high as it too is viewed as a reliable store of wealth away from fiat which is easily manipulated by governments and their rogue leaders. A public blockchain based banking system would unveil countless shady transactions that are clearly still going on. In a world dominated by banking scandals, money manipulation, and trade wars, Bitcoin is looking like the better bet.

But historical analysis suggests we may have seen the end of the sub-$10k bitcoin for good.  While the recent pullback from 2019 highs may have been concerning for some, a look back through bitcoin price history shows that they are actually pretty commonplace. From mid-2015 through to the December 2017 all-time high, there were 8 such pullbacks occurring every 98 days on average. Each of these was followed by a new surging uptrend, which eventually drove BTC to $20,000. Bitcoin just had its first >30% pullback, down from $13,850. There were 8 pullbacks of this magnitude in the last bull market with an average of 98 days between them. This could be the last dip until November. #bitcoin Chart credit @Josh_Rager pic.twitter.com/qadQyd5bvb — James Todaro (@JamesTodaroMD) July 2, 2019  As pointed out by Blocktown Capital managing partner, James Todaro, this could mean that we may have seen the last major dip until November – and potentially the last time we’ll ever see Bitcoin under $10,000. As we are still in the early stages of this bull market, most analysts believe we still have a long way to go. The most recent pullback saw bitcoin briefly dip back under the psychologically significant $10k level. Shortly after however, it was snapped up by eager buyers who managed to force momentum back in the opposite direction. So with bullish sentiment still high, it seems unlikely that we will witness another opportunity to buy at under $10,000 this time around. But could bitcoin price ever go back to four figures? To determine this we could possibly look to yearly lows. These indicate the growth of HODLers, and the price below which they will not sell under any circumstances. In 2018 the yearly low was $3200, off the back of an 85% crash in bitcoin price from its all-time high. This was still a full 4 times the previous yearly low of $780, off the back of both a monumental bull and bear market. As we are at the start of a new bull market cycle right now, it seems very unlikely that we will dip as low again – even if the price does crash later on in the year. But what of our all-time high? Prolonged bear markets have historically wiped around 85% off previous ATHs. Where would the end of this bull run have to be, in order to put $10k back in reach of a crash of this magnitude? Folks of a religious disposition may want to look away now. The magic number which would see an 85% drop take us back to $10k, is $66.6k. So as long as we moon by Christmas, we’ll be fine.

It’s market dominance is now heading towards highs not seen since 2017. Bitcoin price has continued to push higher since it topped $11000, 24 hours ago. There was clearly huge buying pressure at four figures and some have suggested that BTC may never fall that low again. The gradual crank higher has taken Bitcoin price to $12000 again during the morning’s Asian trading session. It is now exactly 25% higher than the dip on Tuesday. BTC price 1-hour candles.

Bitcoin is currently the top performing crypto asset in the top twenty with a gain of over 5% on the day. It doesn’t look like slowing down either as fears of Trump induced dollar manipulation to start to fester.

Xinhua News Agency — a government-run media outlet in China has published a report showing the increasing prominence of Bitcoin as a haven asset. The market study identified tensions between the U.S. and China as well as monetary policy decisions from central banks around the world as reasons for investors pivoting towards the top-ranked cryptocurrency.

The crypto support added by Sino Finance also includes candlestick charts and the latest news. Despite the ban on trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs), cryptocurrency appears to still be a popular topic in the country with rising search trends on Baidu. Bitcoin’s status as a hedge against uncertainty also gains further significance when compared with the performance of mainstream haven assets like gold, and currencies like the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen.

Unveiling new volume data across several bull and bear markets in Bitcoin’s history, Woo, who is a well-known Bitcoin proponent, highlighted some rapidly-changing consumer habits.  Commentators have been split over the character of Bitcoin’s 2019 bull run, with previous analysis suggesting it has little in common with previous cycles except for that in 2012.  Woo appeared to maintain this, noting how few bitcoins are actually moving this year compared to 2017 and 2014.  “Notice how few coins are changing hands on-chain in this cycle,” he wrote on Twitter June 2.  “I put this down to more HODL activity off-chain, and more lockup.”  Continuing, he suggested that if the 2012 behavior were to repeat itself, BTC/USD could be looking for a retracement down towards the $7800 and $9000 levels, before a new upside recovery is launched. “The volume support… could form the base in which the main bull run launches. That’s a really wide zone between $7800-$9000. I wouldn’t call this a target, just a possible outcome if we repeat 2012,” he summarized. Woo was commenting amid a sudden downturn for Bitcoin price, which saw the largest cryptocurrency dip below $10,000. Since then, markets have staged a comeback, climbing 20% to $11,400.  One explanation for the volume data could, as Woo stated, lies in off-chain activity figures.  As Bitcoinist reported, off-chain use of Bitcoin, principally via the Lightning Network, continues to expand apace this year as developers release consumer-oriented tools to make it more accessible.  Further support has come in the form of corporate endorsement, led by Twitter and Square CEO, Jack Dorsey, who publicly pledged to integrate Lightning into both his companies’ offerings.  Even on-chain, meanwhile, Bitcoin has had a record few weeks; breaking volume highs during June and restoring the faith of analysts who feared the bull run was overly optimistic.  Attention remains focused on the coming weeks and months, when institutional product launches should generate even greater volumes and publicity for Bitcoin markets.  Bakkt, ErisX and Binance are all slated to launch Bitcoin futures this year. The first of these, in the form of Bakkt, will begin a trial in July, following months of delays as executives attempted to iron out regulatory hurdles.  At the same time, the industry continues to recover from findings that Bitcoin trading volumes reported by many exchanges were in fact fabricated.  What do you think about the Bitcoin-US dollar volume data?

Descending channel has broken to the upside within the last 24 hours resulting in price levels returning back to POC (Point of Control) around $11,300. BTC on the 30 minute chart clearly shows the most recently formed descending channel. The price action has seen bearish momentum come to a crashing stop around $9,800 as bulls regain control and force a breakout to the upside. The current market price is sitting around visible range POC and 0.382 retracement fib level, where it is now increasingly likely to rise back up to yearly highs over the coming weeks of July. The most recent breakout should provide confidence again for buyers, and eventually escalate into FOMO. We could see Altcoins struggle to show any promising opportunities to enter whilst BTC continues on upwards.    The best method to catch dip entries and breakout entries on both Bitcoin and other altcoins, is known as ”scaling”, where a trader buys/sells in small increments over a period of time to achieve the best dollar cost average. Typically, this is seen on larger time scales for traditional markets like the stock market, however, this technique works wonders for managing risk when trading crypto within shorter time frames. The primary reason for implementing a dollar cost average technique, when entering or exiting market positions, is to minimize risk by neutralizing short term volatility. However, this routine method also removes irrational and emotional decision making from the process. By scaling in and out of the market, a trader allows his/herself the ability to stop worrying about the market and intra-minute / intra-hour chop, because they are executing a pre-defined strategy. There is no set in stone % that a trader should be scaling out at either price point. However, off-loading 25% of their position at each (3) profit targets leaves them with the remaining 10/25% of their full position still in the coin, should they think the price will go higher. The whole idea behind ”scaling” in and out of market positions is to average in the best cost-effective entry whilst managing risk. This allows a trader to adopt a flow with the market and stagger their entries into three positions, as opposed to going ‘all in’ on one point. This is called ”running with the trend”, where a trader is simply buying as the trade goes in their favor. This means if the crypto asset ”fakes out” and dumps, a trader will only lose on a % of their full intended market position. Adversely, when you scale out of your position (taking profit, or stop loss) you allow the trade room to grow instead of panicking and taking profit too early, setting out clear profit/exit points take away the emotional decision making (panic selling).

The recent 30% correction however, has got everybody questioning ‘is now still a good time to buy?’. Here are 3 reasons why bitcoin is not out of the race just yet. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization settled a new year-to-date high of $13,868.44 in June, bringing its maximum gains up by more than 275%. While a substantial correction to the $9,651 level ensued, bitcoin still managed to sustain its previous upside momentum by climbing back above the $11,000 level during the Asian session today. The price action noted across the course of the previous three months shows a surge in bitcoin trend. Bitcoin’s bullish bias has further improved on the sidelines of a gloomy macroeconomic outlook and chest-thumping fundamentals, within the cryptocurrency industry. Here is the list of three crucial factors that have positioned bitcoin for a massive bull run this year. The pool of government debts with negative yields has pushed beyond $13 trillion following a dovish outlook in both the US and Europe. The recent SWOT Analysis found that 40 percent of global debt is now delivering a negative yield, which is a very profound shift. Government bonds in Sweden, Switzerland, and France dropped below zero for the first time. European Sovereign Returning Record Low Yields on their Bonds | Image Credits: Bloomberg, US Global Investors At the same time, Jon Hill of BMO Capital Markets predicted that bond yields in the US, which touched its historic low following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates, is now set to go below the 1 percent level. He told Bloomberg, If we’re in a world where the Fed is seen as returning to the zero lower bound, and then starting another QE program, that could easily be enough to push 10-year yields below 1%,” Gold’s rise to its six-year peak in June is reflective of the gloomy mood in the global debt market. At the same time, bitcoin, which exhibits the commercial properties of the yellow metal, surged higher on the news. That explained that investors are looking outside their usual strongholds as they seek for assets that provide at least decent returns. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC said on Tuesday that it is cautious about the investing in bond markets. The region’s most significant investor borrowed its pessimism from the ongoing US-China trade war, saying the political struggle between the two economies is preparing their fund for lower returns in the coming fiscal quarters. “We are more concerned compared to last year because the developments over the last 12 months have been more negative than even what we were thinking about,” CEO Lim Chow Kiat told Reuters. One reason for the rise in BTC price may have to do with the the trade war between the US & China. A second is that the US Democratic Party continues to shift to the possibility of a wealth tax. Third, Facebook is now launching a new cryptocurrency, Libra. https://t.co/1jFImJPHKM — Mark (@makeordo) June 30, 2019  While significant funds like GIC are planning to diversify their investments in Vietnam, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the US-China tussle, small investors are looking into more open markets like bitcoin. Garrick Hileman of the London School of Economics observed a strong inverse correlation between Chinese Yuan and bitcoin. The researcher believed that traders in China are hedging their capital in bitcoin until trade tensions come to ease. “This is not the first time we’ve seen significant increases in the value of bitcoin taking place alongside yuan concerns,” Hileman told SCMP. “We also continue to see growing recognition of bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ and it is used as a hedge against various macroeconomic risks.” A sign of progression between the US and China during the recent G20 Summit in Osaka on Friday coincided with a 3 percent downside correction in the bitcoin market (which later ballooned by up to 19 percent). But, according to Thomas Lee of Fundstrat, such a positive development on a macroeconomic scale does not hurt the cryptocurrency’s overall fundamentals. Easing of tensions with US and China and even the surprise of easing restrictions on @huawei does not seem to be hurting #bitcoin $BTC After pullback from $14k to $10k (which TA @rsluymer expected and  was textbook Fibo), Bitcoin seems to be OK with developments. pic.twitter.com/dI7V8qbRCY — Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) June 29, 2019  Prominent market analyst Alex Krüger reminded some of those bullish factors in a tweet today, highlighting the bitcoin’s upcoming halvening event and the hoarding sentiment of miners among them. Reasons why bullish BTC despite the blow-off top: 1. Big buyers out there; 2. Retail not yet participating; 3. Institutional on-ramps about to come online; 4. Macro narratives catching on; 5. Real LT positive macro backdrop; 6. Miners hoarding on the way up; and 7. Halving countdown. Not to mention, the entry of big financial firms such as TD Ameritrade and Fidelity Investments into the cryptocurrency space is also assisting the bitcoin’s bullish case.

According to a tutorial published by Blockstream developer “grubles” via Medium on Tuesday (July 2, 2019), LN users can now create bitcoin Lightning payment channels using c-lightning. This is a significant milestone as Liquid users can now make Liquid-BTC (L-BTC) transactions instantaneously and privately. There are also plans to extend the feature to cover other assets on the Liquid sidechain, such as tokenized stocks and fiat tokens. Details published in the tutorial show that the procedure for running c-lightning on Liquid is the same as on the Bitcoin mainnet. Blockstream CEO took to Twitter on Tuesday to highlight the importance of cross-convergence between Bitcoin layers, saying: Lightning on bitcoin on liquid (L-BTC). Bitcoin layers connecting and converging! (People may not know that Lightning can bridge multiple networks). Lightning on bitcoin on liquid (L-BTC). Bitcoin layers connecting and converging! (People may not know that Lightning can bridge multiple networks). https://t.co/E2Qm9oIuij — Adam Back (@adam3us) July 2, 2019  C-lightning is one of the three implementations of the Lightning Network, with the other two being Eclair and lnd. Blockstream is the developer for c-lightning, introducing features like a full-spectrum wallet and the ability to connect nodes running on the TOR network. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, data from 1ml.com – an LN tracking platform – shows that the network capacity is now close to $11 million. Apart from c-lightning on Liquid, users of the Spark wallet can also make LN payments offline using Blockstream’s Lightning Network implementation. Lightning payments on the Liquid Network is yet another technical milestone achievement for Blockstream’s Bitcoin sidechain. On Tuesday, Bitcoinist reported that the Bitcoin infrastructure developer has debuted atomic swaps on the Liquid Network. The available technological features on the Liquid sidechain appear to be increasingly moving the network towards being fully realized. Lightning implementation and atomic swaps now also join confidential transactions and the ability to issue tokenized assets. Back in May 2019, Blockstream announced the introduction of a security token issuance platform on the Liquid Network. Many of these newly added features to the Liquid threaten to make the unique operating propositions offered by smart contract-focused altcoin projects like Ethereum, Tron, and EOS unnecessary. With more cutting-edge technology that proves to have tangible utility being deployed off-chain, Bitcoin also appears set to become the all-round programmable store of value (PSoV) that these other blockchains claim to be. Do you think that these new tech features being developed off-chain for bitcoin renders altcoins obsolete? Let us know in the comments below. Images via Twitter @adam3us.

Its hope is to cut through the myths and provide unbiased and accurate real-time data for analysis.  If you’ve followed the Bitcoin scene for any length of time you will have undoubtedly come across the old arguments about Bitcoin’s ‘excessive’ energy consumption. From the ‘Bitcoin is boiling the oceans and consuming more power than Ireland‘ brigade, to those who say Bitcoin is the most efficient money ever, and uses mostly renewable energy. But who is right? The answer would seem to depend on whether the person giving it is an ardent fan of Bitcoin, or an adamant crypto critic. It is exactly this bias that the Cambridge University project has aimed to address with the launch of its new electricity tracker. Unfortunately, predicting the Bitcoin network’s entire energy consumption isn’t that easy, and the new data highlights exactly how unreliable most figures have been in the past. The problem is that nobody knows the exact mix of mining rigs being used to mine bitcoin. The CBECI makes several assumptions regarding this, and gives figures for both best and worst case scenarios, along with an estimated actual figure. The best case scenario assumes that all miners are using the most efficient mining rig currently available. Whilst the worst case figure is based on all miners using the least efficient machine which is still profitable from an electricity to reward perspective. Clearly, neither of these situations is very plausible, so the estimated actual figure is a ‘best-guess’, made on the assumption that the truth is somewhere between these extremes. Firstly, its important to note that the worst case scenario puts the figure at about 7-8 times that of the best case scenario – That’s quite a lot of room for marginal error. However, the CBECI website gives a current estimated figure of 7.28 gigawatts. A 7-day moving average is applied to this to smooth out any temporary spikes or drops, and gives an annual consumption of 53.01 terawatthours. This is clearly just a number to most people, so here are a number of handy comparisons to put that into perspective. If bitcoin were a country, it would be in the top 50 highest energy consumers – which is indeed higher than Ireland. A lot higher. But to put this in perspective: The amount of electricity consumed every year by always-on but inactive home devices in the USA alone could power the Bitcoin network for 4 years. The total amount of energy created by the world’s hydroelectric industry could power the bitcoin network x79 over, while ‘Solar, wind, and others’ could keep the bitcoin network running x27. Other ‘fun facts’ include, The amount of electricity consumed by the Bitcoin network in one year could power all tea kettles used to boil water [in the European Union] for 1.5 years So, as you can see, while Bitcoin is not the most energy conservative system in the world, it certainly isn’t going to boil any oceans anytime soon – but maybe a couple of cups of tea in the EU.

Yes, it did dump 30% as many analysts had predicted, but mass buying pressure was triggered when it hit the target so BTC subsequently surged again. Now comfortably back over five figures again, some have seen this as the new floor. The pullback to $9,600 was short-lived. According to Tradingview.com, there were only three candles on the hourly chart that closed under $10000, the lowest at $9,780. Even the one that marked the 30% dip closed in five figures indicating that this could be the last time BTC price trades that low.

Tradingview.com CNBC Futures Now, which has often been considered as a counter trade indicator, has indicated that Bitcoin price may have just found a new floor at $10,000. During the interview on ‘Futures Now’, broker Jim Iuorio stated: “I’m actually starting to see bitcoin for what it may be, and that really is a genuine dollar hedged safe haven asset. At least, it has performed that way over the last six months and ten thousand seems to be a good level here.” Iuorio added that he has been very impressed with the Bitcoin price action so far this year, especially since June when it went higher up as the US dollar fell. Scott Nations, who admitted that he was not a fan of Bitcoin, stated that as digital gold it works well because investors have the belief that it will do well when everything else is doing poorly. Nations added that anywhere around $10k would be a good entry level and for him, the only time he would consider buying Bitcoin as someone who does not usually trade it.

Trader and analyst Josh Rager is in agreement. “We had our 30% pullback so what’s next? History says that price consolidates followed by an average gain of 153% before the next big pullback.” Consolidation at this range would not be a bad thing and may give some of the altcoins a chance to wake up a little. So far they have been hopelessly anchored to Bitcoin on the downsides but have done very little on the upsides.

In a blog post published on its official Medium account, FTX provided details about new research into crypto wash trading carried out in conjunction with Alameda Research — a liquidity provider. According to the company, 68.6% of crypto trading volume on indexes like CoinMarketCap (CMC) are fake. The figures provided by Alameda’s research are significantly lower than the figures provided by Bitwise Asset Management, earlier in the year. The company explained the reason for this discrepancy stating that the studies conducted by Bitwise used parameters that over-filtered virtual currency trading volume, erroneously characterizing ‘real volumes’ as ‘fake.’ An excerpt from the full research report reads: While our methods are not foolproof, we believe they paint the most accurate picture of the true nature of cryptocurrency trading volume that anyone has made publicly available as of yet. Alameda’s methodology involved testing the legitimacy of the trading volume data attributed to various crypto exchanges against six parameters such as manual inspecting of trading data, comparison between order book depth and volume to mention a few.  According to Alameda, a manual inspection of trading volume for many exchanges showed clear evidence of wash trading. Elaborating further, the researchers revealed: Some had many prints going up mid-market, much larger than any orders they had on their order books. Others were reporting other exchanges’ prints as their own, on a small time delay. Others did somewhat more sophisticated things, such as slipping in large fake prints only when they have a large number of smaller prints to hide them among. And in other cases, they found …many exchanges’ market pages display many trades which never appeared anywhere on their order books prior to the prints themselves occurring. Trades print significantly larger than any orders that exist on the order books, at prices squarely in 2 the middle of the order book both before and after the trades For many of these trade volume ‘spoofers’, the main goal is to gain a higher rank on CMC so as to attract hefty listing fees from altcoin cryptocurrency projects. It also serves to lure new customers on to the platform, who think these exchanges have higher levels of liquidity than they actually do. The more customers on the platform, the more transaction fees the exchange profits from. Take an exchange like CoinBene, for example. Alameda’s research identifies the platform as among those engaged in transaction mining to prop up its trading volume. Data from CMC shows the cryptocurrency exchange as the 6th-largest crypto exchange by trading volume — reporting $1.75 billion of trading volume over the last 24-hours. Yeah right.    Three months on from suffering a $100 million hack, the platform is yet to refund its customers. Complaints on the platform’s Telegram channel is met by the usual refrain of “wallet maintenance.” The research paper went on to name and shame several more ‘major’ exchanges that were renowned for faking trading volumes, …major exchanges which are known to engage in transaction mining are FCoin, Bitforex, Coinex, Coinbene, and Coinsuper As part of the research, the Alameda team also provided a weighted score for 50 different cryptocurrency exchange platforms with a percentage pass or fail score attached to each based on a comparison of their volumes with those of reputable platforms.

On Monday, July 1, Roubini, nicknamed crypto’s “Dr. Doom,” called CZ a jerk for doubting the scope and relevance of his frequent appearances at crypto-related conferences and events. The Bitcoin skeptic didn’t hesitate to brag about his influence in the crypto industry. The most pathetic critique I have heard about me is from this jerk @cz_binance; I was chosen as the 3rd most influential person in the world in the crypto space coz I am the only honest critic of this shitty space who isnt talking his book 24/7 the way you do snake oil peddler https://t.co/t3BlZ2aGpH — Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) July 2, 2019    Both Roubini and CZ attend the 2019 Asia Blockchain Summit in Taipei, Taiwan. The event hosts prominent crypto leaders as speakers, including BitMEX co-founder and CEO Arthur Hayes, TRON founder and CEO Justin Sun, and Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, among others. On Monday, Twitter user Crypto Godfather, CEO of blockchain-oriented magazine Block Journal, shared a tweet, commenting on Roubini’s presentation at the summit. 💀 Dr. Doom dropping the knowledge on this crypto conference!@Nouriel pic.twitter.com/akgOcpl5Ia — Crypto Godfather (@CryptoGodfatha) July 2, 2019  CZ replied to the tweet, questioning Roubini’s zeal to attend crypto conferences while being a well-known critic of the industry. The Binance CEO doesn’t understand what does the US economist has to do with the crypto space. for a guy who doesn't see the future of #crypto, but yet, spend days attending crypto conferences.

Maybe he is the disguised Satoshi??? — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) July 2, 2019  Roubini, who teaches at New York University’s Stern School of Business and runs a consultancy firm ,Roubini Macro Associates, spotted CZ’s comment and retorted with the sharp reaction. The economist called CZ a “jerk” and a “snake oil peddler.” The dispute didn’t end here, as CZ reacted by making fun of Roubini with another tweet, asking who the jerk was in fact – a guy who acts based on his beliefs or a guy who bashes Bitcoin at crypto conferences.

Or A guy who goes to crypto conferences just to call bitcoin a scam? https://t.co/NHSh0Z8VOO — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) July 2, 2019  Needless to say, almost everyone supports CZ in this online dispute, with many criticizing Roubini even under his own tweet. Roubini seems to feel comfortable fighting alone against an entire industry that is expanding at a fast pace. He is going to debate with BitMEX chief Arthur Hayes on Wednesday, as he claims that the trading volume on BitMEX is fake.  The battle has already started on Twitter, with Roubini claiming that BitMEX was trading against its own clients. Nevertheless, Hayes is ready for the fight.

Now check out these three amazing facts about Bitcoin that will make you stop and think. The wild ride that Bitcoin has taken us on over the years has been dramatic. Horrifying, intense, elating, and crushing all at once.  But while many of us are glued to the price action, it’s easy to forget that the sweeping majority of the world don’t have a clue what Bitcoin even is. Let that sink in for a moment. There were just 32 million wallets registered as of Q1 2019. That’s less than 1% of the entire global population using Bitcoin. While Bitcoin may be all-consuming for you, keep in mind that you’re still part of a very small club. Facebook may be the corporation that takes cryptocurrency to the masses and eventually brings them accross. But there’s still a very, very long way to go before Bitcoin becomes massive. There are currently 49 dictatorship countries in the world. That represents around 50% of the global population. Almost four billion lives that Bitcoin could help to change. These are mostly people who have no say in the dilution of their national currency, censorship of the media, or access to bank accounts.  China may have banned people trading cryptocurrency, but Bitcoin is unbannable. You can’t ban open-source distributed software. Even if the internet is shut down, you can send Bitcoin via SMS or beam the network down via satellite. bitcoin Still, think it’s all about the price volatility? According to Blockchain.com, the Bitcoin network hash rate just reached an all-time high at 69 quintillion hashes per second.  If that sounds like a rather large number, that’s because it is. Some 10 times the number of grains of sand on Earth in fact. That may leave your mind blown or it may leave you wondering who’s ever counted the grains of sand. Either way, it’s pretty impressive indeed.  While it may seem like it’s all about the price especially in recent weeks, there are plenty of facts about Bitcoin that highlight just how special it is. And how early on in the game we are. Satoshi’s creation could help more than four billion people around the world escape dictatorial regimes. It could change the way people think about money and provide them financial freedom. But they have to be made aware of it first. There are still many obstacles to face.  You might wake up today disheartened by the 11% 24-hour drop. But keep in mind that beyond the hype and speculation, Bitcoin has real power.

The latest surge in #bitcoin has been accompanied by big volume in #tether. Watch as @krakenfx CEO @jespow details to @OJRenick why the controversy over the stablecoin is much ado about nothing.$BTC $USDT — TD Ameritrade Network (@TDANetwork) July 1, 2019  Kraken CEO, Jesse Powell, has been vocal in his condemnation of the New York Attorney General’s ‘misplaced’ recent accusations around Tether and Bitfinex. Given the latest surge in USDT being created, he was asked if he could reassure crypto-cynics as to Tether’s legitimacy. Obviously, Powell replied, he has no inside knowledge of what is happening inside Tether. However, he did confirm that a growth in Tether supply does usually coincide with a growth in US Dollars flowing into Bitcoin. When new Tether is printed, 99% of the time, it constitutes a massive influx of US Dollars flooding into exchanges. The interviewer then raised concerns that certain participants know in advance about the creation of new Tether. Could they potentially use this knowledge to artificially inflate prices? Again, Powell reiterated that the printing of Tether is reflective of new dollars coming into the system. It is not artificially inflating the price of bitcoin. When bitcoin price goes up 10% in a day, this is because exchanges are on-boarding  50-100,000 new users per day. The boost is down to resurgent media attention and new users, not tether – he argues. Finally, Powell discussed calls to delist Tether, and whether the NYAG could influence this. Firstly, Powell pointed out that the NY attorney general has no jurisdiction over Kraken. However, Kraken consistently monitors all the assets it lists, and if something turns out to be a scam then it will be delisted. As of right now, Tether does not fall into this category. Additionally, Powell suggested that delisting was a measure that should always be treated with caution. Sometimes, he said, it is worth listing an asset for price discovery, even if the token is controversial. If a token is listed then people can price that risk, and possibly disagree. Delisting a project removes easy access to that project. People cannot close their position if they have lost trust in a project, and they do not know what the price really is. Powell said that he would prefer exchanges to be more of a neutral platform. Having said that, he did state that Kraken tries to only list legitimate projects which have some merit. TD Ameritrade is one of a number of institutions who are increasing their exposure to cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoinist reported in April, the company has quietly begun testing BTC spot trading, in a move which could see an influx of institutional investment.

The firm aims to bring Bitcoin and crypto to the masses by developing new user-friendly tools to facilitate the transfer of digital assets. In October last year, Blockstream launched its Liquid Network which was touted as the world’s first production bitcoin sidechain. According to the blurb on the company blog: “The Liquid Network provides fast, secure, and confidential transactions to address the needs of exchanges, brokers, market makers, and financial institutions around the world.” It adds that through Liquid’s Issued Assets feature, members can tokenize fiat currencies, securities, or even other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin enters the Liquid Network through a peg-in process, where BTC is locked on the main chain and an equal amount of Liquid bitcoin, L-BTC, is issued on the network. In May Blockstream revealed its new Liquid Securities platform, a user-friendly solution for businesses issuing security tokens on the Liquid Network. Major exchanges such as BitMEX are currently looking into using Liquid sidechain technology to reduce its impact on the Bitcoin mempool and reduce transaction fees, as reported by Bitcoinist last month. According to Forbes, Japan is also keen on using the technology to streamline the entire blockchain transfer procedure. The Canadian blockchain infrastructure startup has taken the platform a step further this week with the announcement of the Liquid Swap Tool. “We’re excited to announce the Liquid Swap Tool. This new tool allows users to execute atomic swaps on the #LiquidNetwork for any issued asset such as L-BTC, tokenized fiat, crypto assets, attested assets, & more.” We're excited to announce the Liquid Swap Tool. This new tool allows users to execute atomic swaps on the #LiquidNetwork for any issued asset such as L-BTC, tokenized fiat, crypto assets, attested assets, & more.

The move is another step towards increasing the efficiency and decreasing the costs of sending and receiving bitcoin and other crypto assets. There were very few other details on the new tool available on the company website aside from installation instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who was responsible for creating hashcash and cited in the bitcoin whitepaper, spoke at a seminar on financial innovation at the Group of 20 (G-20) meeting in Fukuoka, Japan, last month. He said that it was challenging to even keep up with the pace of new things that are being developed before adding; “It strikes me that there are still major discoveries about the implications of the tech being found, so we’re still early stages for what can be built. So, I think it does provide a sort of programming model for electronic cash, and it’s surprising the number of things you can build on layers above it that retain interesting properties of what’s beneath,” His firm is one of the pioneers in new technology that aims to bring about a truly decentralized financial world where instant peer-to-peer transfers can become a reality for everyone.

ErisX gained approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to offer physically-delivered futures, in which participants take delivery of actual Bitcoin, rather than the cash equivalent.  A more ‘hands-on’ option than traditional futures models, commentators hope physical futures will aid understanding of the crypto space as investors take on the responsibility of storing their coins.  Bakkt, the institutional investment ecosystem geared to crypto by New York Stock Exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, will begin rolling out its own physical futures in the third week of July.  Now, it has emerged a source from within the crypto industry itself will compete in the form of Binance, which will offer its product in the coming months.  CEO Changpeng Zhao confirmed the plans at the ongoing Asia Blockchain Summit, Binance set to compete with longstanding market heavyweight BitMEX in the derivatives market. The multiple market entries represent something of a coming of age for Bitcoin among institutional traders, who have until now kept a low profile in the face of uncertain regulatory landscapes.  In the US, the picture remains mixed, with Binance likely set to exclude the market from its offering.  Overall, however, the picture for proponents remains positive. “More sophisticated products. More liquidity,” Morgan Creek Digital co-founder, Anthony Pompliano, known as Pomp, tweeted in response to the news. Beyond institutions, retail on-ramps, such as Tether-based buy-ins via over-the-counter trades in China, are contributing to Bitcoin’s ongoing bull run. The knock-on effect from the launch of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency will provide more publicity in future, say commentators, but its introduction could be tricky. Once again, as Bitcoinist reported, it is the US which is demanding regulatory dialog before any tokens see a release. What do you think about the latest Bitcoin futures announcements?

The correction has gathered momentum this week and BTC price made two dips to $9,950 a few hours ago according to Tradingview.com.

The majority of altcoins have done very little since their bear market lows in December 2018. A lot of the higher cap coins including XRP, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Stellar and Tron are still over 80% down from their all-time highs. Some are even over 90% down still. Chao added that we are now entering the fourth market cycle for Bitcoin and in previous ones, there was a distinct correlation between the altcoins and BTC. This has not been the case in 2019 when altcoins have been stagnant while Bitcoin has surged. Last month a number of altcoins including XRP, BCH, EOS, Stellar and IOTA actually dumped a fair amount while crypto market capitalization in general increased by 27%. As BTC cools altcoins are freezing over again, many have dumped double digits over the past couple of days as the correction deepens. Total market capitalization has shrunk by $80 billion since late last week however bitcoin’s share of that remains over 60%. Chao could be on to something as the calls for altseason have so far gone unheard as many of them are still in the depths of their own crypto winters. Will Bitcoin price rally to $100,000?

On the 4-hour BTC/USD chart we can see that the price 00 is struggling to print a higher high after correcting from its YTD-peak of $13,850, on June 26.   Right now, the latest reaction low appears to have picked up along a strong sideways support between the $10,850 and $10,600 levels, which was a particularly strong foothold for BTC buyers during the end of Q2. If bullish traders can defend this support, we could expect a new upside recovery launch over the rest of this week. If it fails however, it is likely that panic selling will exacerbate bitcoin’s decline, and test the strength of the psychological $10,000 support below.   Looking at the MACD indicator we can see that selling volume is starting to decrease over this time period, however the 12MA still has yet to bullishly converge above the 26MA to convince us that a new uptrend is starting.   The RSI remains uncertain, and has pushed sideways as neither buyers nor sellers appear to have taken full control of the asset.   For now, we will need to wait and see where the daily close finishes to see if BTC bulls still have enough fight in them to push back against the mounting selling pressure.    It’s only when we compare the 4-hour and daily BTC/USD price actions, that we really see cause for concern. As you can clearly make out, the trends on both charts are very similar, and show a clear spiking uptrend followed by two smaller peaks that both retrace back to a lateral support.   The latter chart, which shows the progression of last year’s tragic bear market, concluded with a bearish descending triangle breakout which sent Bitcoin reeling 50% over 30 days.   Looking at the 4-hour chart above, we can see that BTC has just pulled back from its second peak and is already starting to head beneath the main support region, as it did so on the daily chart last year. Assuming the price action continues to follow in its previous footsteps, we could expect to see the asset continue to print lower highs until it reaches maximum consolidation inside another descending triangle pattern.   From there, we would anticipate for BTC to break bearish through the main support and plummet towards lower levels.   Where do you think Bitcoin is headed over the rest of this week?

According to Blockchain.com, the Bitcoin network hash rate is at a new ATH of 69 quintillion hashes per second (69 million terra hashes per second – TH/s). Hash rate refers to the computing power used in securing the network.  Since topping 60 quintillion TH/s back in mid-June 2019, the hash rate has continued to increase. This growth is in tandem with the trend established in 2019 as technical fundaments have been on the rise since the dip experienced in late 2018. The Bitcoin network hash rate is now more than 2x the level it was in December 2018 and has grown by about 900 percent in the last two years. Mining difficulty is also at an all-time high, furthering the network’s robust security.  To put the significance of the current hashing capacity of the Bitcoin network, consider the following. According to a research team at the University of Hawaii, there are about 7.5 quintillion grains of sand on the earth. As Kevin Rooke put it, in a tweet published on Sunday (June 30, 2019), “every single second, the Bitcoin network performs 10x as many hashes as grains of sand on the planet.” If 69 quintillion is a number that feels too large to comprehend, consider this… There are an estimated 7 quintillion grains of sand on earth. Every single second, the Bitcoin network performs 10x as many hashes as grains of sand on the planet. — Kevin Rooke (@kerooke) June 30, 2019  Even more impressive is the fact that renewable energy powers about three-quarters of that computing potential – a fact often conveniently overlooked by Bitcoin mining critics. Bitcoin doesn’t need men with guns to protect it – a point famously made by Economics professor Saifedean Ammous back in 2018. Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital makes a similar point in Monday’s episode of “Off the Chain.” Bitcoin’s Department of Defense (DoD) doesn’t comprise of a nuclear arsenal, instead, the top-ranked cryptocurrency has network stability inbuilt. According to Pompliano: Bitcoin’s Department of Defense has no bullets, no bombs, no ships, no fighter jets, and no soldiers. It has thousands of volunteers and millions of computers around the world that are cooperating to ensure there is no single point of failure. Given the bullish sentiments that exist within the market, it isn’t inconceivable to imagine more hashing power being added to the network. It’s the rainy season in the Sichuan province so more miners might be flocking there to take advantage of cheaper hydroelectric power. Bitcoin’s hashing power is 10x that of the grains of sand on earth, who’s to say that number won’t top the estimated 1,000 quintillion stars in the universe.

At the KOPItech food-court in the newly refurbished Funan mall, customers order through self-service kiosks or via Facebook Messenger using QR codes located on each table. More interesting than this, however, is the ability to pay using cryptocurrency. Amongst other payment methods, the kiosks accept bitcoin, ethereum, and creatanium (which must be popular in Singapore?). The KOPItech system cost around S$500,000 (USD $370k) for Kopitiam to develop in-house. The cryptocurrency payment option was included due to CEO Alden Tan’s own interest in blockchain. Allowing cryptocurrencies will help us to learn more about this segment of the payment system. This group of customers may grow in the future, so this is what we want to attract. We are always mindful of how we could add more customers to the foodcourt. Interestingly, conversion from cryptocurrency into fiat will take place on a weekly basis, with Kopitiam bearing the risks of any currency fluctuation. Stallholders will receive payment in Singaporean dollars as usual. If the response to the KOPItech food-court at the Funan mall is positive, Kopitiam will consider rolling it out to other outlets, cryptocurrency payments and all. It seems like accepting bitcoin payments in retail is on the rise again, after a lull that saw many early adopters drop the technology. Recent months have seen luxury hotels and car dealerships in Switzerland start to accept payment in cryptocurrency. And one major US retailer is ditching Visa and considering payment through Lightning Network payments at its nationwide chain of drug stores. New technologies and payment processors mean that it is easier than ever to start taking bitcoin payments. Conversion to and from fiat can also be processed instantly, so there is no need to expose a business to the vagaries of price volatility. How big do you think this is for bitcoin adoption?

Beginning last week, the country’s government opted to stop transactions in the US dollar and reintroduced the stricken Zimbabwean dollar, which disappeared in 2008 amid unbelievable hyperinflation. The move caught citizens entirely by surprise, with the cash squeeze compounding anger about economic policy.  “Watch (Bitcoin) usage and prices spike in Zimbabwe, where, like everywhere else, ‘the full faith of government’ is just economic jargon,” Olaoluwa Samuel-Biyi, director of remittance service SureRemit, commented about the situation June 24.   Zimbabwe officially pulled the plug on allowing cryptocurrency to circulate legally in 2017. At the time, economic woes were ongoing, and Bitcoin once again saw huge local mark-ups.  Zimbabwe has had no cryptocurrency exchanges since May last year, with trading thus necessarily occurring on P2P platforms such as Localbitcoins.  The phenomenon closely mirrors similar stories which continue to define Bitcoin’s rise in mainstream culture. In particular, it is countries such as Venezuela where citizens have put their faith in crypto in the face of unreliable fiat alternatives.  Discussing threats to stage mass protests if the Zimbabwean government does not change course, Azte.co CEO Akin Fernandez thus forecast a persisting appetite for Bitcoin going forward – should authorities also attempt to enforce their existing ban. “Replace ‘USD’ in this story with ‘Bitcoin’ and you get a glimpse into the future of not just Zimbabwe, but every country on earth,” he wrote on Twitter.  They’re right to reject these measures wholesale. Money is a service that should be provided exclusively by the market, and never by the State. While data for Zimbabwe’s Bitcoin trading is not available, according to statistics for last week compiled by monitoring resource Coin Dance, global volumes have hit new records. Decentralized exchange Bisq (formerly Bitsquare) led the surge, with Localbitcoins still losing traffic after officials removed the option to exchange for cash last month. As Bitcoinist reported, the decision did not prove popular, with competitors actively luring traders elsewhere.  Bisq managed to generate volumes of $10.7 million in the seven days to June 29, a number far above the week prior, which at $6.1 million was in itself record-breaking.

Discussing the impact of changes in areas such as the US-China trade war, Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors noted that Bitcoin was moving for other reasons.  While the largest cryptocurrency had jumped as tensions between the two nations rose, a surprise truce last week failed to undo any of the gains.  “Easing of tensions with US and China and even the surprise of easing restrictions on (Huawei) does not seem to be hurting (Bitcoin),” Lee summarized. “…Bitcoin seems to be OK with developments.” Easing of tensions with US and China and even the surprise of easing restrictions on @huawei does not seem to be hurting #bitcoin $BTC After pullback from $14k to $10k (which TA @rsluymer expected and  was textbook Fibo), Bitcoin seems to be OK with developments. pic.twitter.com/dI7V8qbRCY — Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) June 29, 2019  As Bitcoinist reported, geopolitical events appeared to boost Bitcoin several times this year, with developments such as Brexit uncertainty also occurring alongside major price moves.  In June, theories focused on Chinese buying behavior in particular as potential motivation for Bitcoin rising to $13,800. Despite buying and selling cryptocurrency being illegal in China, investors are thought to use stablecoin Tether as an entry point.  Speaking to mainstream media, a source at JPMorgan Chase said US-China pressure on markets could keep lower until September. Jing Ulrich, managing director and vice chair of global banking and Asia Pacific at the bank, told CNBC, I think for now, markets have taken on a more optimistic and upbeat tone at least since the weekend. And I think this optimistic tone will continue for the next couple months Lee was commenting before a fresh correction hit Bitcoin markets, with support failing to hold at $11,000 on Monday.  The retracement, however, was broadly expected. A parabolic rise to almost $14,000, which followed three months of solid gains, should notionally end in a pullback to preserve long-term potential, analysts said.  This week, predictions as to exactly how low that pullback will go continue to take shape, with one theory centring on a floor between $6500 and $7000.  Industry developments may yet change that trajectory, with institutional trading platform Bakkt set to begin testing its long-awaited Bitcoin futures in week three this month.  For many industry figures, there remains plenty of reason to be bullish. Barry Silbert, the CEO of cryptocurrency investment conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG), ridiculed gold traders failing to profit off the same geopolitical upheaval as Bitcoin. DCG portfolio member Grayscale Investments saw its public fund, the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), set records in recent weeks. What do you think about current Bitcoin price behavior?

For many it is a store of value, for some, it is a trading vehicle, but for Venezuelans, BTC is the most reliable hedge against the rampant hyperinflation the Latin nation is suffering. The inflation has reached such epic proportions that the Banco Central de Venezuela has printed more new notes with a lot fewer zeroes on them. According to an official statement last week the government has printed new banknotes of 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 bolivar denominations. The release added that the new bills are aimed “to make the payment system more efficient and facilitate business transactions.” According to one Venezuelan posing on Reddit, the new notes have already been devalued. “Government issued new Bolivares banknotes. 10,000 Bs. 20,000 Bs. and 50,000. Bs. 50,000 Bs. are around 8 USD, since the time they announce them and people get them at the banks they have lost 10% of the value. This after 5 zeroes were shaved from the currency less than a year ago and 3 zeroes more 12 years ago. So it would be 5,000,000,000,000 Bs.” During last year’s monetary reform the state announced the launch of a new re-denominated Bolivar which shaved five zeros off the national currency. The ‘sovereign Bolivar’, or Bolivar Soberano (VES), replaced the super inflated ‘strong bolivar’, Bolivar Fuerte (VEF), which had itself replaced the original currency in 2008, when three zeros were chopped. President Maduro claimed that the new VES currency would be anchored by the oil-backed state-issued digital coin, the Petro. Economic conditions in Venezuela have continued to spiral out of control as political clashes escalate. According to the International Monetary Fund inflation is expected to hit 10 million percent this year. The Financial Times reports that the number of people fleeing the country could reach 8 million by the end of next year making it the biggest recent exodus anywhere on the planet. When a state manipulated currency decreases in value people need to look elsewhere in order to survive. Bitcoin would be the savior in this instance and, according to Coin Dance, more Venezuelans are turning towards it. Volumes have surged to all-time highs of over 45 billion in recent weeks as bitcoin surged to new highs for fifteen months.  Venezuelans are not the only ones looking towards Bitcoin as a hedge against economic oppression; it is also going on in Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey. People are slowly waking up to the mess that their governments are making and realizing that there is a viable and safe alternative in Bitcoin. Would you switch to Bitcoin over fiat?

In an exclusive chat with Bitcoinist, SMC Capital partner, Mik Mironov, explains why he believes weekend cryptocurrency trading has exploded over the last month. First off, he points to a rise in Chinese retail interest in bitcoin as one of the leading catalysts for the recent boom. Mironov, a partner at a New York-based blockchain investment fund, says a new wave of crypto exchanges are coming online in mainland China. This is in spite of the blanket ban on crypto trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs) imposed by Beijing back in 2017. Explaining further, Mironov revealed: Retail trade from China is on the rise and deserves our close attention. Ever heard of Biki, Bliss, and MXC or Zg.com? These are all the new crypto exchanges in mainland China launched in recent months. They already run business with millions of users acquired by deploying large marketing campaigns, and that’s amid the infamous crypto trading ban. To add, zg.com is a fiat to crypto platform accepting Chinese RMB. The SMC Capital partner also highlighted the entry of “new crypto traders” into the market. These fresh participants weren’t part of the 2017 bull run and will likely have more novel trading patterns and habits that might set them apart from the general herd. Mironov also provided another proof of increased BTC interest in China based on a parabolic rise in searches for bitcoin and crypto on WeChat – the country’s largest social media platform with over 1 billion monthly users.  As for the 2017 bull market, the consensus is that FOMO-driven hype contributed to the bull market frenzy, where every cryptocurrency recorded new all-time highs. The hysteria around ICOs played a part in driving the cryptomania, and Mironov believes initial exchange offerings (IEOs) might be having a similar impact on the market now. Apart from China, Mironov also identified India as another FOMO trigger for bitcoin. The VC’s stance draws heavily from the fact that the country’s government appears to be headed down a path of a total ban on cryptos. With local exchanges shuttering since 2018, crypto traders in India seem to be turning to foreign-based platforms. This trend has led to growing user traffic and trading volume for some of these exchanges. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, BTC price reached a $500 premium in India last week. According to Mironov: In the second quarter of this year, KuCoin has seen a doubled monthly traffic due to the recent Bitcoin bull run. The global exchange’s daily trading volume reaches 200 million, almost tripled compared to the number two months ago. KuCoin now already has 5 million users globally and it continues to grow rapidly. In emerging regions like SEA and South Asia for instance, KuCoin experienced drastic user growth in the last couple of weeks.  Over the last 7-day period, bitcoin topped $13,900 before a price retrace saw the top-ranked crypto fall almost 25%. Bulls will be hoping BTC is in an around the $12k mark with the hourly chart showing bitcoin in danger of slipping below $11,500. Do you think the influx of new retail trading money from China will see bitcoin top $20,000 in 2019? Let us know in the comments below. Images via Tradingview.

This would allow for sideways consolidation to take place around $9,000, which is a key historical psychological support/resistance level allowing volume to rush back into the Altcoin market.   On the Bitcoin 4hour chart we can begin to see a descending channel forming. This is not yet confirmed as there’s only 2 out of 3 needed points of contact from candlesticks to my predicted channel support and resistance. Descending volume would align nicely with a pull-back to $9,000 region around the 200EMA confirming the descending channel. My short term price prediction for the next few days is evidently bearish, given the expected pullback, however, a pullback to $9,000 forming the descending channel would still keep the current uptrend intact. It’s highly likely once the descending channel has been formed there will be a breakout to the upside that attempts to form new highs. Descending channels formed during an uptrend are inherently bullish. Consolidation within the predicted descending wedge would likely allow Altcoins room for short-term growth. Overall, a pullback would be nothing to be scared of, as stated in this previous analysis. and is much needed to sustain the current uptrend, whilst allowing Altcoins to bounce off their historical supports that many of them are currently resting on.  On the BTC weekly chart we can see ascending volume, the opposite to what we can see on the 4 hour chart. This accompanied by the fact that there’s been no red weekly candles since February of 2019 is a great indication that a brief pullback is needed. POC (Point of Control) sits around $6,200, this is also where the CM Super Guppy indicator has flashed green, meaning there’s a significant amount of support, and large orders resting against the market around this price point. It’s highly unlikely price levels will drop below the $6,200 mark, I would consider this the critical support level, meaning if this is broken the overall uptrend for BTC is also broken and would be a significant sell signal. Key support levels to look out for between current market price and critical support are $9,500, $8,000, and $6,800. There’s a significant chance BTC will wick down extremely fast to liquidate longs, and cause panic across the market before regaining traction, this has happened before every bull phase in BTC history, thus something every trader should prepare for. MACD has clearly crossed the median to the upside as a result of the most recent uptrend. It’s likely a pullback will cause MACD to move sideways during this period before turning up again. BTC dominance is currently 61.9%, I expect a pullback will take BTC dominance back to 55-57% region, which is the percentage that sustained the previous altcoin bull phase throughout Q4 of 2017. The current overall Crypto market cap is sitting around $333,000,000, this will need to continue steadily increasing towards the $500,000,000 mark to really allow Altcoins to flourish, whilst BTC begins it’s brief pullback.

But has Bitcoin been in the party spirit this week?… Or has something rained on our parade? So Bitcoin price looks like ending the week with a gain of around $1,500. But there will be many who are disappointed with this outcome, as mid-week it looked like it could be so much more. After last weekend’s pump which saw Bitcoin break past through $10000 and then the $11000 barrier, the price has been steady. There was no Monday correction, as there has been after many of the (now regular) Sunday rallies. Bitcoin’s seemingly unstoppable rise led many to question when (or indeed if) altseason was coming this time around. Somewhat predictably, it compelled (Bitcoin-accepting) gold-bug, Peter Schiff, to start mouthing off about bubbles again. Seemingly Schiff is unaware that bubbles which occur repeatedly might be better-called market-cycles, but whatever. Grayscale’s BTC Trust was trading at a 40% premium as institutions flocked, which represented a Bitcoin price of almost $15k. Could more be on the way? It certainly could, and on Wednesday it came, with price blasting through first $12k and then $13k. A new yearly high was posted as price stopped just short of $14,000, before a £1k pullback to close. Hopes were, that Bitcoin price would continue to skyrocket, but then Thursday saw a flash-crash, which largely resolved itself back to $12,300 on Friday. Saturday saw a minor drop of around $500… …and then this morning price poked its head above the $12000 parapet once more. Of course, Bitcoin price volatility is very normal and not something to worry about, but sometimes people need a little reassuring. So, the self-proclaimed inventor of Bitcoin, Craig Wright hasn’t had everything his way this week. In anticipation of his Florida court date over Bitcoin allegedly mined with Dave Kleiman, a New York-based crypto lawyer weighed in with his interpretation. Wright faces potentially being held in contempt of court for failing to provide his owned Bitcoin addresses. However, the lawyer thinks that (the deceased) Kleiman’s brother, is hoping for a confidential out-of-court settlement, in return for not exposing Wright as a fraud. When Wright finally got his day in court, he only managed to antagonize the judge, who threatened to have him “in handcuffs so fast [his] head will spin”. Well, I’m sure none of us want to see that. Tom Lee of Fundstrat, and John McAfee of… John McAfee, both say that altseason is coming, and will be here before the end of the year. Likewise, FOMO hasn’t really started yet as Bitcoin price is in ‘stealth-mode’, but it will hit and hit hard when price breaks past $20000. Bitcoin miners in Iran are setting up in mosques to take advantage of the free electricity they receive in the country. We seem to be rich in ‘who is Satoshi Nakamoto?’ theories at the moment. The latest speculation points to the founders of Guardtime, in Estonia, because… well anything’s better than Craig Wright, isn’t it? How do you think Bitcoin fared this week?

Consolidation around $12000 appears to be forming and the uptrend is still clearly very strong. Over the past 24 hours BTC has been slowly grinding higher adding almost 5% on the day. From around $11,500 yesterday Bitcoin price has ticked up over the $12000 barrier to settle at around 00 during the Sunday morning Asian trading session. Daily volume is back down to ~$28 billion and the next high will be critical in determining the next direction for BTC. BTC price on hour candles – Tradingview.com Bitcoin price is still down 12% from its peak last week but the big thirty percent correction has been nowhere in sight. Many are now wondering if that was it and a 25% flash crash was all that markets could muster. If this was the case, then the digital asset is still extremely bullish and the next leg up could take it to new highs. Looking at the weekly chart there is very little resistance from its recent high of $13,800 all the way up to $17000. Even mainstream media has turned bullish on Bitcoin with both Bloomberg and Forbes publishing pro-crypto articles recently. The latter claimed that Bitcoin has been designed for systemic stability, not price stability. “Bitcoin, by contrast, is a system that prioritizes security over price stability. Bitcoin’s systemic stability stems from the security of its network. This week, as bitcoin’s price volatility was capturing headlines, I was watching core bitcoiners get excited about something else entirely—the network’s hash power hit an all-time high, and its “difficulty” also adjusted to an all-time high.” Very few altcoins can match the performance of Bitcoin price at the moment. BTC market dominance is still at an 18-month high of over 62% even after a 12 percent slide. Only one altcoin is making any momentum this Sunday and that is Litecoin which has surged almost 14% on the day to reach $132 again. Naturally, LTC was always going to bounce back first since it is now only 36 days to the block halving event. The move has enabled Litecoin to flip BCH again and retake fourth place as market cap tops $8 billion. The rest of the major altcoins are slow to recover with XRP, BCH, EOS, BNB, BSV, and ADA only managing a couple of percent back from their double-digit dumps over the past few days.

Facebook’s recently launched “cryptocurrency”, Libra, is the latest cause of fury, angst, and fear amongst regulatory bodies. Threatened by the growing adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, governments and bankers are asking for more regulations and stricter scrutiny over crypto assets. Especially, after Facebook’s announcement of plans to issue their digital coin Libra, lawmakers and regulators around the world immediately expressed concerns regarding the social media giant’s caprice and irresponsibility in handling user data. The rising popularity of cryptocurrencies has forced key European leaders, such as French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, and German conservative MEP Markus Ferber, to make urgent calls to regulate and control cryptocurrencies. Le Maire actually intends to form a task force for the G7 countries to investigate digital currencies. Randal Quarles, chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), believes that innovations like crypto-assets may challenge any regulatory framework. Thus, he has been asking regulators across the world to exercise more stringent controls over the use of Bitcoin and other crypto assets for retail payments. On June 25, 2019, addressing G20 leaders in Osaka regarding the topic of how to contain the risks of financial innovation, Quarles said, “One example is crypto-assets. A wider use of new types of crypto-assets for retail payment purposes would warrant close scrutiny by authorities to ensure that that they are subject to high standards of regulation. The FSB and standard-setting bodies will monitor risks very closely and in a coordinated fashion, and consider additional multilateral responses as needed.” Unlike Bitcoin, Facebook is a corporation, and it will have to withstand strict reviews from numerous interested parties. Reuters writes, ”Besides central banks, markets regulators, consumer protection watchdogs, and agencies that tackle money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes, Facebook’s payment network might also have to adhere to the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures that are set by the Bank for International Settlements and the International Organization of Securities Commissions.” Ignorance is one of the main causes of fear. Many government officials simply do not know how crypto assets work and what their impact could be on the financial markets. Authorities in Singapore, for example, foresee significant hurdles that will make things difficult for Libra. In effect, Ravi Menon, Managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, is concerned about the Facebook virtual currency project. According to Bloomberg, although acknowledging that cross-border transactions are “expensive, inefficient, and sometimes risky,” Menon could foresee Libra’s potential benefits. However, he said, “The key challenge is to figure out the nature of the beast. What is it more like and which box we can put into? At this point, we are not sure.” How do you think the advent of Facebook’s Libra will affect Bitcoin in terms of regulatory scrutiny?

Fortunately, law reporter, Carolina Bolado, was there to tweet progress as it happened. Wright was in court as defendant in the case brought by the estate of Dave Kleiman, over the alleged theft of 1 million bitcoin. The bitcoin in question was supposedly mined by Kleiman and Wright in the early years after Kleiman purportedly helped Wright to develop Bitcoin. He had previously been ordered by the court to give a list of his owned bitcoin addresses. When questioned by his own law team, Wright repeated his claim, that he “just can’t get this information,” and that it wouldn’t provide the plaintiff with anything relevant anyway. Through tears, he said that he was ashamed of his ‘invention’, and bemoaned the fact that people had used it for criminal activity. Supposedly, he created the ‘anonymous’ digital currency, intending it to be the only crime-free money. During cross-examination, Wright was presented with a printout of a pdf of an email, which the prosecution claim was forged. Although the email is dated December 2012, and purports to be from Kleiman, the PGP signature was generated in March 2014. Kleiman had been dead for a year at this point. Wright showed his disdain for the document by screwing it up and tossing it aside, much to the chagrin of the judge. He reprimanded Wright, saying, “You throw another document in my courtroom you will be in handcuffs so fast your head will spin.” ""You throw another document in my courtroom you will be in handcuffs so fast your head will spin"" — Judge Reinhart — Carolina Bolado (@CarolinaBolado) June 28, 2019  While Wright claimed that Kleiman’s counsel was trying to mislead the court, the email in question had been provided by his own legal team. The topic of questioning then turned to the blind-trust in which Wright claims to have put his bitcoin. Kleiman’s counsel put it to Wright that the beneficiary of a trust he supposedly created in 2012, was a company he didn’t buy until 2014. Wright responded that he didn’t recognise the documents, although the counsel claimed they were ‘produced by [Wright] in discovery’. When asked who holds the 15 key slices, 8 of which are needed to access the bitcoin supposedly in trust, Wright replied that he ‘didn’t know off the top of his head’. Apparently, nobody asked him to check the file. Although he clearly knew that he had been requested to provide the public keys in court. The judge took over questioning, and Wright claimed that he gave some keys to Kleiman. These were to be given to bonded couriers, and Wright said that some won’t be available until 2020. The judge was again, less than impressed with only finding this out at this juncture: So since 2016 you have known that you didn’t have access to these files and wouldn’t have access until 2020? And you knew this in February 2019, and March 2019? There was no time to complete the proceedings, so parties will have to reconvene at a future date to hear testimonies from expert witnesses.

The vitriol and FUD make headlines but it is largely based on ignorance of the technology and its ethos. Industry giant Bloomberg may finally be warming up to bitcoin, however, but will others follow? Bitcoin appears to have finally started its correction from a rally which has added almost 270% to its price since the beginning of the year. The big names in mainstream media are dedicating larger slots to BTC and its brethren as the crypto winter has thawed. In a recent Bloomberg opinion piece, the outlet finally admitted that crypto is here to stay. The obvious question is this: If Bitcoin was just a bubble to begin with, why has it been bouncing back in this manner? The answer is that cryptocurrencies, in some form or another, are probably here to stay. The report goes on to surmise that the recent US-China trade war may have had something to do with bitcoin’s epic but volatile run over the past couple of months. Adding that China will not liberalize and continues with its capital controls, these may be factors driving people to use bitcoin, which is still technically banned in the People’s Republic. The second reason Bloomberg thinks bitcoin is here today has something to do with the harsh tax laws in the US. With proposed wealth taxes the rich are going to look for offshore stores of value untouchable by gluttonous governments, and BTC fits the bill perfectly. Facebook’s Libra project has also been cited as a boost for bitcoin. Naturally, one billionaire and a bunch of US tech monopolies controlling a global currency is not a good scenario but it will introduce the concept of crypto transfers to millions of people that may have otherwise never dabbled. Facebook’s Libra App An increase in populism and intensifying geopolitical and economic tensions across the globe could spur people to look for hedges against their own highly manipulated fiat currencies. Yet again, bitcoin is the clear solution. Gold prices are a clear example of this as they have reached a six-year high as the greenback tumbles in value across the planet. What the writer did not add is the increased interest from institutional investors. Major investment firms such as Fidelity and Grayscale have barely started, and Bakkt is also on the way to provide a safe way to enter the scene. These funds will be loading up on bitcoin and crypto in order to provide liquidity and competitive products to their institutional clients. Rounding off the article reconfirms that the financial space is changing and crypto is going to be a very big part of that in the future. If we have had a hard time seeing the resiliency of the crypto space, it is because we are not used to thinking of futures that are radically different from the present. But those futures — for monetary institutions at least — now seem to be closer than ever before. Will bitcoin ever make it as a global currency? Add your thoughts below.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is a prime example as institutional interest has surged more than the asset itself. Bitcoin appears to be still in correction mode. It did climb back up to reach $12,400 for a few hours yesterday but has since dropped back to support at around $11,500. The lowest point in the recent pullback was $10,300, a drop of 25% from its $13,800 high. Many are expecting a 30% plus decline which would send BTC back into the mid $9,000s or lower. Regardless of what the crypto asset itself does, institutional investors are hungry for more. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has been performing exceptionally well since February and has surged over 300% according to Forbes. The report added that the over the counter bitcoin backed security is trading at around $14 per share, up from $3.84 five months ago. In the same period bitcoin itself has gained over 220%. The discrepancy can be attributed to the increased premiums that institutional investors are charged as they are prevented from directly holding the asset. According to the editor of Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter, John Dobosz, the GBTC has destroyed other investments such as gold, oil, the S&P 500 and various tech ETFs. “The total gain since that time for the GBTC, which tracks bitcoin pretty accurately, is up 341%. What comes in second best? You would have been okay with oil, even though oil has eaten dust and other particles in the last few weeks. Oil is up 12.8%.” He added that the S&P 500 is up 8.5%, gold is up 7.7%, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF is up 1.4%, the Invesco QQQ for tech companies is up a lowly 1.7%, and the US dollar is up just 1%. The report continued to state that the reason for this monumental performance could be the fund is the only publicly quoted US-based bitcoin investment product, which holds more than 1.2% of the total supply of BTC. Grayscale has invested in other crypto assets including Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Stellar, Ethereum Classic, XRP and Zcash with total assets under management of $2.7 billion. 6/28/19 UPDATE: Holdings per share, net assets under management and digital assets per share for our investment products.

More interestingly, though, there are major updates underway already. A user going by the name of u/almkglor has taken to Reddit to discuss some of the upcoming updates on Bitcoin’s scaling solution, the Lightning Network. The first at hand is the channel update protocol touted “Eltoo.” According to the user, Eltoo will be solving the network’s “toxic waste” problem. Under the current protocol, the old state is considered dangerous (hence, toxic) because if it’s acquired by someone else, they can use it to publish a stale unilateral close transaction that must be treated as a theft attempt. Hence, you could, in theory, get punished and lose funds. With the new update, the old state is not being revoked but, instead, it’s gainsaid by the later state. Moreover, it would allow multiple participants in the updated protocol. Naturally, Eltoo comes with a few setbacks as well. It would require a base layer change and it would make determining the costs of the routes a bit harder, hence complicating routefinding algorithms. In essence, the purpose of this update is to split larger payments into smaller ones. There are three different variants of the AMP implementation. These include: In terms of benefits, the above would provide better-expected reliability, as well as the capacity for multiple channels to be used to pay. However, it also suggests higher fees and it’s not particularly clear how to split up the payments. Instead of using preimages and payment hashes as it is right now, this update would replace them with payment points and scalars. The invoice would contain a payment point and the receiver would reveal the payment scalar (a private key). This would allow for a whole lot of further improvements such as noncustodial escrow, payment decorrelation, stuckless payments, and so forth. Now, it’s also worth noting that these are just a small part of the updates which are underway for the Lightning Network. As Bitcoinist reported earlier in May, there are 13 upgrades intended to solve the network’s biggest hurdles. Moreover, according to LN tracking resource 1ml.com, the network capacity is at almost $11M, while the number of nodes has increased by almost 4% over the past month to reach 8,896.

But while this seems like a daunting thought, there are some who actually believe that this is a good thing.  A Twitter thread from Bitcoiner and Stanford Law student, Conner Brown, makes the case for volatility. Volatility is good.👇 1)It shakes out weak hands and makes sure Bitcoins go to the strongest of hodlers. 2) It’s free Bitcoin advertising. Volatility makes headlines. 3) It’s a direct function of Bitcoin’s unparalleled absolute scarcity. Supply is static so price is volatile. — Conner Brown (@_ConnerBrown_) June 28, 2019  Firstly, volatility can help to shake out weak hands, leaving bitcoin held by those who truly believe in it. After all, somebody has to sell the dip. If no publicity is bad publicity, then volatility provides free marketing for Bitcoin. Sure, the mainstream media like to crow about how worthless Bitcoin is when the price drops, but that also draws attention to the fact that it has risen so much. So bitcoin is back below $12k (for now); three months ago it was around $4k. Arguably, volatility is a direct function of Bitcoin’s scarcity. As the supply is static, the price is naturally volatile due to changes in the global market demand. Finally, the post argues that we need volatility if Bitcoin is to go from nothing to a global reserve asset. Certainly, we wouldn’t even be thinking in those terms if Bitcoin price was still less than a dollar. Exactly, and fortunately Brown goes on to address this. He posits that money is an evolutionary process, and new money is not born as a perfectly stable and liquid store of value. Whilst it would make little sense to price things in Bitcoin currently, Brown suggests that this phase comes later. Once Bitcoin grows and the store of value phase is over, it will become very stable. In fact, says Brown, it will become more sensible to price things in bitcoin than the dollar. As the dollar is a fluid monetary base, prices are systemically distorted, as monetary liquidity can be injected for artificial gains. Bitcoin has no such mechanism, thus will, according to Brown, “form the most stable and predictable monetary base humans have had.” He concludes by saying that although… BTC volatility might require some patience… in the short term, [it] will build an economy where truly terrifying volatility (i.e. artificial bubbles) are no more. So whilst, in a bear market, we may praise a reduction in volatility as a good thing, remember that it is that self-same volatility which facilitates the explosive break-outs in a bull market. The downside of that, of course, is that we sometimes have to face dramatic pull-backs. What do you think about Bitcoin’s recent volatility? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!

As social media users and the local press report this week, around one hundred miners are now participating in the Bitcoin network from local mosques. In Iran, mosques get free electricity from the government, making them an ideal location for the energy-intensive mining process.  A photograph uploaded to Twitter and subsequently translated into English by Oxford University researcher Mahsa Alimardani appears to show a setup at an unnamed mosque. She commented. There’s around 100 here, producing around $260,000 USD a year. This money goes a long way in Iran’s choked sanctioned economy Mosques receive free energy in Iran. Iranians have set up Bitcoin miners in them. There’s around 100 here, producing around $260,000 USD a year. This money goes a long way in Iran’s choked sanctioned economy. https://t.co/fczwdqCPAd — mahsa alimardani 🌒 (@maasalan) June 26, 2019  While not everyone believes the mosque phenomenon is genuine, $260,000 is still no small amount for citizens of a country which faces economic turmoil and sanctions which are increasing rather than decreasing in 2019.  The latest political fracas with the US has taken its toll on the already heavily inflated Iranian rial, with black market rates now hovering at 132,000 to the dollar. In 2015, at the time the previous US administration signed a new treaty opening up Iran to the world economy once again, the exchange rate was 32,000.  Over the past 2 years, Tehran, the capital of Iran, has been curiously bearish about cryptocurrency despite its sanctions-dodging potential.  In April 2018, Iran’s central bank issued a formal note to banks telling them not to serve crypto businesses, a decision which preceded announcements that the government would issue a cryptocurrency of its own.  In September, meanwhile, the state conversely took the step of formally recognizing Bitcoin mining as an industry.  That move again appears to run contrary to events this week, as authorities seized one thousand mining units after alleging they caused a 7 percent surge in power usage.  “Two of these bitcoin farms have been identified, with a consumption of one megawatt,” Arash Navab, a power official in the central province of Yazd, told local TV quoted by Reuters. According to news outlet Iran Daily meanwhile, the Ministry of Energy plans to cut off power to all miners until tariffs for electricity change.  They “will be identified and their electricity will be cut,” the publication reported, referencing an official at the ministry, Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi. June had previously seen the unveiling of an unlikely addition to Iran’s mining scene in the form of a ‘sanctions-dodging’ skyscraper.  Do you think Iran’s mosques are sheltering Bitcoin miners?

This new theory however, points towards Estonia as Satoshi’s possible place of residence.  We all know how advanced the tiny eastern European nation of Estonia is when it comes to technology. But the fact that Estonia started experimenting with blockchain technology the same year it was invented in 2008 is hardly proof that Satoshi Nakamoto was living there at the time. However, according to a thought-provoking Medium article, there’s some pretty compelling evidence to suggest that Estonia was actually his/her home. Moreover, his/her identity has been narrowed down to four potential people or collaboration. According to Crunchbase, Mike Gault is the CEO and founder of Guardtime, an Estonian software company that he has led for 10 years. Guardtime, according to evidence uncovered by the author, has been working with blockchain since 2008 (the year it is known to have been discovered).  Here is where it gets more interesting. Gault started his career researching quantum devices in (wait for it) Japan. He then worked as a derivatives and quant trader in Tokyo. His Ph.D in electronic engineering came from the University of Wales. All of the above would explain the Japanese connection, the exact timing, and the perfect English. Bitcoin’s creator, Nakamoto, always claimed to be a 37-year old Japanese male. However, using the occasional British spelling and not documenting his software in Japanese would suggest otherwise.  Moreover, according to Wikipedia: Nakamoto claimed that work on the writing of the code began in 2007.  (Guardtime turned on its servers on 07/07/2007) Do all these pieces add up? Joichi Ito was born in Japan. This again explains the Japanese connection. However, he lived in the United States and Canada until he was 14. After that, he returned to his native Japan and attended an American school.  This would explain the perfect English, but not the Britishisms such as “bloody hard” found written in the source code comments. However, guess who Ito was firm friends with? Mike Gault.  Ito was a key member and investor in Guardtime, the creator of the first ever Japanese website, and a well-known venture capitalist, early-stage investing in the likes of Twitter, Dopplr, Kickstarter, and many other internet companies.  He’s also highly vocal on emergent democracy and the sharing economy, and the author of Emergent Democracy.  Saarepera and Buldas invented the hash calendar. They also jointly founded Guardtime in Estonia in 2006 (which contradicts the Mike Gault profile on Crunchbase). On top of that, they jointly published a paper in 2007 that seems to outline blockchain almost perfectly. As Estonians, this does not explain the perfect English or the Japanese connection. This would seem to suggest that Satoshi Nakamoto is a collaboration between these four people or a company–Guardtime. Of course, until someone other than Craig Wright comes out proclaiming to be the mysterious Bitcoin and blockchain inventor, this is all mere speculation. But it certainly seems plausible when you add up all the pieces.  Moreover, when the Medium author Kimberly Forsythe reached out to all four men, Joichi Ito replied saying “ha!”… Not exactly confirmation but not a rejection either. And so the plot thickens. What do you think of this new theory? Are you convinced? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!

According to the market analyst known on social media as CL, bitcoin returning to the significant $10,000 barrier is exciting for longstanding market participants, but not for the public. Lay consumers, a dedicated report says, will only show real interest once BTC/USD passes its existing all-time high around $20,000.  CL summarized.  What is surprising… or unsurprising, is how little the public knows about this. Less informed people still think Bitcoin was just a craze, or that it is still currently trending toward zero  He continued, What’s more, data suggest that Bitcoin is currently going through the initial ‘stealth phase’ of its bull run… This means that Bitcoin’s bull run has only just started and have (sic) ridiculously more room to grow before the next cycle top.  The report surfaced on June 24, when BTC was tackling $11,000. Since then, a new peak has emerged at $13,800 before an expected correction took the price down to $10,380. Bitcoin then bounced off fresh support to retake $11,000 again on Friday, with BTC/USD currently around $11,800 as yet another growth spurt kicks in.  Cryptocurrency is slowly returning to public consciousness, thanks mostly to mainstream media articles which nonetheless continue to criticize its volatility. For CL, however, current phenomena such as an uptick in Google search popularity are background noise. “This stealth phase is characterized by significant bitcoin growth however with minimal public attention,” he added.  “In fact, there (are) as much Google searches for ‘Bitcoin’ today at over ($10,000) as in 2013 when Bitcoin was only at ($1,000).” As Bitcoinist reported, analysts remain broadly divided over both the causes of the current bull run and where it is heading beyond the immediate short term.  Theories range from Facebook’s cryptocurrency unveiling to institutional interest and geopolitical uncertainty, while technical indicators attempt to chart what is likely to happen next. One metric, Trace Mayer’s Mayer Multiple, which divides the current Bitcoin price by its 200-day moving average, suggested this week that a fairly-valued price for BTC by the end of 2019 is $21,000.  This would handily place Bitcoin above its all-time high, allowing for CL’s public interest – and potential associated ‘FOMO’ (‘fear of missing out’) – to kick in.

Cryptocurrency optimists take long positions, while traders who are bearish take short positions. According to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data, big money traders, such as hedge fund managers, have been taking bearish positions. The Wall Street Journal reports, Hedge funds and other money managers held about 14% more bearish ‘short’ positions in CME bitcoin futures last week than they did bullish ‘long’ positions, according to a recent Commodity Futures Trading Commission report. So, when on June 26, 2019, the cryptocurrency neared the USD 14,000 mark, traders who had taken short positions were forced to execute massive liquidations.  Hedge managers and other large traders have been bearish on BTC since February 2019. However, a bearish position taken by a hedge fund manager does not necessarily mean a bet against the cryptocurrency, as The Wall Street Journal explains, Such data don’t necessarily mean hedge funds are placing outright bets that bitcoin will drop. The short bets could also be part of hedging strategies: for instance, a fund with a portfolio of bitcoins might go short at CME as insurance against the value of bitcoin dropping. Moreover, positive signals about BTC continue to abound. For example, small investors remain bullish. According to The Wall Street Journal report, traders with fewer than 25 BTC contracts hold long positions outnumbering short bets by four to one.

Research suggests that most Binance institutional clients expect this ‘dominance’ to stay high.  According to figures from CoinMarketCap, bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap (or ‘dominance’) recently rose to 62.9%. This is largely due to the current bitcoin rally, and the fact that we are still waiting for ‘altseason’ to begin. The last time bitcoin had this proportion of total market cap was back in December 2017 when the price was climbing to all-time highs. Back then ‘dominance’ hit a level of 66.8%, before dropping as low as 32% just a month later. For a higher level still, we must look back to April 2017. Prior to this, bitcoin consistently held a higher percentage of total crypto market cap. However, at this time the altcoin market was still in its infancy and most alts were yet to find their feet. According to the latest Q2 survey by Binance research, over 50% of VIP and institutional clients predict that bitcoin ‘dominance’ will be in the 40 – 60% range at the end of 2019.  A further 30% of respondents predict that bitcoin’s share of the total market cap will remain in the 60 – 80% range that it currently finds itself. This ‘illustrates the special status of Bitcoin as the bellwether of the cryptocurrency and digital asset industry’. The Binance survey also found that 56% of its VIP and institutional clients are HODLers. The survey defines this as holding positions for an average of over a week. However, it is questionable whether many would agree with this definition. 22% of respondents engage in high-frequency trading (HFT), where positions are held on average for less than an hour. There are many who don’t think that ‘proportion of total crypto market cap’ is a true reflection of bitcoin’s market dominance. It would perhaps be better named ‘market (cap) share’. The issue is that pure market cap gives no consideration to the liquidity of different coins. Many tokens that appear to have a large market cap, trade less than 0.1% of this as a typical daily volume. Their true value in the market is, therefore, less than a coin with a slightly smaller market cap, but with greater volume. John-Paul Thorbjornsen investigated exactly this, as he expected the cryptocurrency to conform to some kind of Pareto Distribution. He found that by considering liquidity and comparing ‘market dominance’ using a volume-weighted market cap, gave the expected results. By this method, Bitcoin’s dominance of the market has consistently been over 80%. Do you think Bitcoin dominance will continue to rise over the rest of this week?

This is the first time the leading asset has printed a double digit loss against the US dollar since May 17 – over 40 days ago.   On the 1D BTC/USD chart we can see that bears have now regained control of the over-extended Bitcoin market today, after the asset failed to break above the $13,400 during the American trading session (13:00 PT) yesterday.   The correction has so far driven BTC price 00 down as far as -15%, however bullish traders have already managed to recover over 9% of the opening drop after finding temporary support at the 0.5 fibonacci level below ($11,337).   A sharp decline like this has not appeared on Bitcoin’s chart since the ‘F*** You Reversal’ pattern that played out 41 days ago. But while that pattern turned out to be a bullish reversal signal, this new pullback looks more like a capitulation after a buyers could no longer fuel bitcoin’s vertical climb.  Unsurprisingly, the sell off has triggered buying volume on the MACD histogram to decline. This is the first time we’ve seen volume on the daily chart deviate towards the signal line since June 15 – 12 days ago.  There are some positives to this decline however, that should be noted. The pullback has tipped the RSI back into the index channel from the overbought region, as momentum returns to regular levels. This is a welcomed sign for exhausted bullish traders, and should ease some of the short-term selling pressure weighing down on them. It also creates room for a new uptrend once buyers regain composure.    On the 1-hour BTC/USD chart we can see that the price is beginning to consolidate in, what appears to be, a falling wedge pattern. Typically these patterns are bullish reversal patterns, and breaks out once the asset reaches maximum consolidation between the two pinching trend lines.   In order to confirm this, we will need to wait and see if the lower support will hold through the current panic selling period, and drive BTC towards the maximum consolidation point which sits on the 0.5 fibonacci level.   As mentioned in yesterday’s analysis, the fibonacci levels have played pivotal roles in supporting and resisting bitcoin’s movements over the last few months. It’s very possible that once candles retrace back on to this key level, bullish traders will find a strong enough foothold to launch a new upside recovery back towards the 0.786 fibonacci level above.  If it fails however, then we should look to the lower 0.382 fibonacci below at the $9,426 level, as the next most likely major support.

With an epic surge of almost 270% in 2019 the FOMO has been palpable; almost something you can physically touch. Something huge could be driving it, like one nation including BTC as a reserve asset, or it could just be the nature of things on crypto markets. Major volatility has returned to the crypto markets over the past week. Bitcoin started out on Monday trading at just over $10k after breaking this psychological barrier. Since then the king of crypto has surged a mind-blowing 30% to top out at $13,800 a few hours ago. What followed can only be described as a flash crash, dumping $2k in less than 2 hours. Bitcoin rapidly shrugged it off however and quickly returned back to just below $13k where it currently trades 00. Many have been looking for solid fundamentals to explain this monumental momentum. Economist and trader Alex Krüger hypothesized that one major nation could be stocking up on BTC in preparations to use it as a reserve asset. “$BTC is trading as if a large nation were about to announce the inclusion of bitcoin as a reserve asset. That’s how bullish price action has been. The buying pressure during the Asian session was extraordinary.” $BTC is trading as if a large nation were about to announce the inclusion of bitcoin as a reserve asset. That's how bullish price action has been. The buying pressure during the Asian session was extraordinary. (just an analogy, not saying that's the case) — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) June 26, 2019  For most days this week trading during the Asian session has dominated proceedings for markets around the globe. The US has simply picked up what Asia started, leading Bitcoin prices ever higher. Considering the actions of US President Donald Trump recently, Asian countries and the Middle East would do well to distance themselves from the greenback and consider an alternative reserve currency. The US is now dishing out sanctions like candy, trade wars which in turn are creating unprecedented levels of protectionism and economic upheaval, with local currencies being depreciated. The USD is currently down against many of the world’s major currencies and stock markets have also been rocky recently. Smart nation states wanting to hedge on a truly decentralized and global currency would be looking at buying and holding Bitcoin. The list of those wanting to distance from the dollar is growing and includes Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, and of course rogue states such as North Korea. Once the first nation announces that it is officially accumulating BTC a cascade effect is likely to follow as others follow suit. At the moment this is all hypothetical but for those looking for an explanation of the recent surge, this could be a part of it. Which country is most likely to be accumulating Bitcoin?

In a blog post issued June 27, Rahul Raj, CEO of Koinex, said the company had no option but to suspend trading indefinitely.  The announcement is the latest in a string of surrenders from the Indian crypto exchange industry, which has faced more than a year of mistreatment by banks and regulators. Raj commented, After months of uncertainty and disruption, we have regretfully decided to shut down all digital assets exchange services and operations today It is, without a doubt, a sad day for all digital assets and blockchain enthusiasts in India and we can’t express in words how hard it’s been for us to make this decision. Koinex began operations in 2017 and within four months saw 24-hour trading volumes hit $265 million as bitcoin reached its all-time high of $20,000.  As Bitcoinist reported, beginning last April, India’s central bank began instructing financial institutions to ban crypto businesses from accessing banking support.  The move hit exchanges hard, with many well-known names either halting trading or moving abroad.  “We have consistently been facing denials in payment services from payment gateways, bank account closures and blocking of transactions for trading of digital assets,” Raj revealed about the reality of continuing to operate after the ban.  Even for non-crypto transactions like payment of salary, rent and purchase of equipment, our team members, service providers and vendors have had to answer questions from their respective banks — just because of an association with a digital assets exchange operator. While the central bank’s decision has since seen a Supreme Court challenge, no definitive changes have yet appeared.  India is becoming one of the most draconian jurisdictions on Earth for bitcoin holders, lawmakers currently considering a legal framework to outlaw cryptocurrency completely. It remains unknown how this policy would work in practice.  “Amidst all of this, from a basic economic feasibility point of view, it is just not prudent to continue doing this business,” Raj continued.  The amount of capital, effort and grit that’s required to conduct a complicated business like this is just increasing with no relief in sight — the infrastructure cost alone for operating the exchange platform and ensuring the safety and security of users’ funds is unbelievably high. Koinex will halt all trading on June 27, thereafter using its own capital to reimburse users as its funds remain under regulatory lockdown.  What do you think about Koinex shutting down?

Many are pointing the finger at exchanges but the bottom line is that BTC has already started to recover and is heading back towards $13,000 again. Another new 2019 high was hit a few hours ago when BTC touched $13,860 according to Tradingview.com. The move meant that Bitcoin price had made almost 50% in seven days, epic by anyone’s standards. What followed was a sharp pullback as a big red candle dumped around $2,000 in just an hour. Bitcoin price hit the 50-hour moving average and instantly headed north again. In industry terms, this is known as a ‘flash crash’, where one massive trigger can induce the dump. It is not a natural element of the market cycle since recoveries are usually instantaneous. BTC price 1-hour candles – Tradingview.com Crypto trader Josh Rager has called it a pullback, however, albeit a minor one in comparison to previous thirty percent plus dumps. “18% pullback on the $BTC day chart. If Bitcoin price pulls down to the mid $10ks… (20+%) I’d consider this a big pullback prior to continuation. At this point in time, I consider Bitcoin extremely bullish. 18% pullback might be the new 30% pullback we’re expecting.” 18% pullback on the $BTC day chart If Bitcoin price pulls down to the mid $10ks… (20+%) I'd consider this a big pullback prior to continuation At this point in time, I consider Bitcoin extremely bullish 18% pullback might be the new 30% pullback we're expecting — Josh Rager 📈 (@Josh_Rager) June 26, 2019  Since the incident, Bitcoin price returned to $13,330 before settling at the $12,750 level where it appears to be holding, down 8% from yesterday’s high. Considering the speed of this recovery, it would not be pertinent to call this a correction as they usually last a bit longer than just a couple of hours. What happens next could be crucial though, if BTC powers back over $13000 then the flash crash was exactly that. If the candles begin to break down however and Bitcoin price falls back below $12000 in the next few hours, we could be experiencing a wider scale correction. A drop of 30% or more from recent highs would send Bitcoin price back to the mid $9,000s where strong support lies. Fellow trader ‘SalsaTekila’ also commented on the pullback and is poised to buy the dip as many others will be. “I hope to be wrong about a $BTC pullback towards 8400$ area but am hedged and prepared to #BTFD if it happens.” 13k was hit ✅ I hope to be wrong about a $BTC pullback towards 8400$ area but am hedged and prepared to #BTFD if it happens. https://t.co/bDqa8wUYF6 — SalsaTekila (JUL) (@SalsaTekila) June 27, 2019  Travis Kling, chief investment officer at Ikigai Asset Management, is also eyeing a larger pullback. Earlier, just before the flash crash, he tweeted “Given this price action, now is a good time for a reminder: BTC is going to pull back. It often does so in savage fashion. There have been 12 pullbacks of >30%. 6 of those have been >70%. Another pullback will undoubtedly occur. Could happen tomorrow.

It’s a well known fact in the crypto market that altcoins typically have their bull market moment after bitcoin has finished its course. With BTC dominance breaking above 60% for the first time in 2 years, it certainly seems like the time is coming for altcoins to enjoy new highs. In a recent tweet, Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, confirms that he believes the altcoin season is coming, and shared a post which highlights 9 small cap coins that are starting to post solid gains. There will be an alt season… https://t.co/lLJKKprbAv — Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) June 26, 2019  Before the ‘April Fool’s day’ rally, altcoins dominated the crypto market with many tokens enjoying a sustained run of price gains. Litecoin (LTC) remains one of the standout performers in 2019 so far with a year-to-date gain of more than 350%.Bitcoin’s break above $11,500 did see many tokens in the red, after investors redirected funds into the #1 cryptocurrency. Once the leading asset starts to show signs of pulling back – which could be potentially around its all-time high- we are likely to see investment redistribute back into the rest of the market. Over the last 24-hour trading period, the altcoin market appears to be recovering. Most of the top-ten altcoins have posted positive price changes within the period. Whether this is an early warning of the new cycle beginning, however, is yet to be confirmed. Echoing Lee’s sentiments, John McAfee predicted that the real winners in the current bull cycle will be a basket of altcoins that will see 10 times the price gain achieved by BTC. Tweeting on Tuesday (June 25, 2019), the internet security legend and renowned crypto advocate said the kings of the altcoin arena will be tokens most affected by 2018’s bear market. Bitcoin cranking up, but the real winners, beginning soon, pwill be the alt coins 10x + the rise in Bitcoin. Top of the heap will be the ones most beaten down in the Bear Market – Docademic, Apollo, XTZ, etc. This is where the real money is to be made. Fill your bags folks. pic.twitter.com/Mgh8KVd4M2 — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) June 26, 2019  Naysayers of such optimistic altcoin predictions will most likely point to the absence of trading volume to ensure such a sustained price run. With the ICO market all but declined, such dead cat bounces might be nothing more than cleverly contrived pump and dumps. A BTC price peak and subsequent bullish fatigue might also be a requirement for altcoin prices to surge. In such cases, bitcoin bag holders sell BTC for alts to catch a double run-up. For now, the top-ranked cryptocurrency continues its seemingly relentless parabolic advance. BTC is up more than 20% in the last 24 hours absolutely brushing past the $13,000 price mark with little resistance. Bitcoin has gained more than in Q2 2019 alone with its market capitalization now firmly above $240 billion.

With so much momentum picking up behind asset, where are bullish traders going to take it next?   On the daily BTC/USD chart we can see that bitcoin price 00 is showing no signs of slowing down. Momentum on both the MACD and RSI indicators is continuing to skyrocket in typical bull market fashion, and buying volume is showing a marked increase as new investment piles in.  Today’s bullish continuation has, so far, added an extra $1,160 to bitcoin price, and set yet another new YTD-high of $12,935.   Right now, anticipated selling pressure at the psychological $13,000 mark is creating temporary friction in the uptrend, however at this stage it appears more than likely that this wall will be overcome before the daily close.   So where is Bitcoin heading next?   Over the last 2 weeks, bitcoin price has been met with notable selling pressure at the 0.382 and 0.5 fibonacci levels ( $9,426 and 11,377 respectively). This suggests that a vast number of investors are trading around these key levels, particularly after bitcoin’s breakout above $7,000.   Between May 30 and June 13, BTC bulls were forced to capitulate down on to $7,600 support, after failing to break above the 0.382 fibonacci level during the opening test. After a short period of accumulation however, a new impulse movement was launched which saw bitcoin break confidently through the fabled $10,000.   Between June 22-23, the next fibonacci level (0.5) created some problems in the uptrend again, but this time bullish traders were able to quickly overpower it within 48hours.   From these two events we can identify two important things;   (1) The next area where we should expect to see some selling pressure will more than likely to be around $13,328, at the 0.786 fibonacci level.   (2) BTC bulls are breaking through each new overhead resistance faster, which suggests that momentum is only growing stronger.  Now that this momentum has reached a point where bear traders are being shaken out, and key resistances are no longer creating pushbacks, it’s incredibly likely that the only price point where we’ll see any real bearish opposition will be at bitcoin’s all-time high at $20,000.   According to information from Datamish, over $45 million in Bitmex BTC short positions have been liquidated in the last 6 hours (see below), and Binance has recently announced  the first liquidation of a Bitcoin short on its new margin trading platform.  These liquidations will undoubtedly be adding more fuel to Bitcoin’s parabolic rise, as the #1 cryptocurrency continues to defy derivative trader expectations.

According to Coindance stats collated from Google Analytics data, Bitcoin users actually share some fairly common interests and affinities. The long and the short of it? They have pretty dull lifestyles. It’s not too surprising that the most common interest among most bitcoin users was financial services and investing. That’s followed by software design and financial services once more. But this time (perhaps more surprisingly) coming from banks. Beyond computers, software, and financial management, Bitcoin demographics confirm that users are pretty much the geeks in T-shirts we suspected they were. Apart from the 2.14% who are interested in dating services of course.  When it comes to affinities, it’s rather obvious that these should go hand in hand with interests. Most Bitcoin users refer to themselves as “avid investors” and “technophiles”. However, there are a few travellers, movie lovers, and political enthusiasts thrown into the mix too. It seems that even Bitcoin addicts need time off every now and again.  Bitcoinist reported earlier this month that female engagement with Bitcoin was at an all-time high. But it was hardly a cause for celebration. After all, more than 90% of Bitcoin users are still male. And a lot of them, at 9.34% are barely out of high school.     Making up the lion’s share of users, Bitcoin demographics show that almost 50% are millennial. Some 28.33% are between 35 and 44, but we’re hardly talking about silver-haired boomers here. Just 1.43% of Bitcoin users are over 65.    Seeing as Google analytics was the source, you’d expect the majority of browsers to use Chrome. However, it’s hard to believe that just 1.76% use a privacy browser like Opera. But who’s to argue with the data?  Despite Google getting plenty of pushback, Chrome is still the number one browser for 62.46% of Bitcoin users. Although that number in itself is significant.  When you consider that Google has over 90% of the global market share when it comes to search engines; at around 60%, Bitcoin users buck the trend.    Last of all, when it comes to Bitcoin, there’s an overwhelming tendency to using a desktop over mobile.  At first glance, that particular fact might not seem very interesting. However, it reveals volumes when it comes to user security. When you consider that nearly 80% of internet usage is expected to have been mobile in 2018, a whopping 75% of Bitcoin users stay with a desktop. That’s a depressing stat when it comes to mobile wallet providers. It’s also another major indicator of how usability can improve in this space. After all, trading often requires multiple screens. From this data, clearly users are more comfortable transacting from the safety of their Mac or PC, than trading on-the-go with their smartphones. Wallets like the Ledger Nano X may be taking strides in pushing people to mobile, but according to the Bitcoin demographics, users aren’t ready just yet. What do you make of these new findings?

Bitcoin’s inexorable rise from December 2018’s bottom to break $12000 has been astonishing in its speed. So what could lie ahead? Barely six months ago we were engulfed in our darkest hour. Crypto-winter seemed here for the long-haul, not helped by the onset of actual winter (in the northern hemisphere, at least). Bitcoin price was hovering in the low-$3,000s, with no indication of which direction it was heading. We’d already crashed nearly 85% from all-time highs, almost exactly one year before. Little did we know then, but the bottom was in and we were on our way up. Six months later we have already regained over half of that 85%, but we started slowly. The slog from the bottom of $3.2k back up to $5k took 109 days. Although a full half of that was in the last three of those days, from April 1 to April 3. Bitcoinist had two weeks prior to this called the end of crypto-winter, on the back of impressive gains in daily volume. Five weeks later, in early May, Bitcoin price broke $6k, but by then the floodgates had opened. Another three days saw $7,000 fall, and two later we’d broken $8k. With the dark days decidedly behind us, it was time for a bit of consolidation. Bitcoin continued to push upwards though, touching $9,000 by the end of May, although it was rejected at the first attempt. Price pulled back to as low as the mid $7,000s to regain some momentum. Next time we attempted $9k we’d be ready. Sure enough, on 12 June, Bitcoin price started to charge. 4 days later it had broken $9,000 again, making us wait only another five days before it smashed through $10k. $11,000 came the very next day (22 June), although it took a further two before it stuck. And now, two days further down the line, Bitcoin price has broken $12k (almost touching $13k at one point), with seemingly little resistance ahead. So where do we go from here? Many are looking to the bull run in December 2017, reminding us that back then the pump from $12,000 to $19,000 took only 11 days. Reminder: Bitcoin previously went from $12k to $19k in 11 days. — Cole Kennelly💡🦄 (@ColeGotTweets) June 26, 2019  But isn’t that missing the bigger picture? Not to say, pre-empting another crash back down from $19,000? Life gets a little more interesting if we look to the previous ATH and crash from December 2013 through into January 2015. From top to bottom on both occasions took around a year, and wiped about 85% off Bitcoin price. However, the rally has been a lot quicker this time. Following the 2015 bottom, it took around 18 months for Bitcoin to regain half of the 85% of value lost. Another 18 months after that, we hit a new ATH of about 17 times the value of that in December 2013. This time around, it has taken just 191 days to recover 50% of 2018’s bear market. So rather than $12k to $19k in 11 days, perhaps we should be looking at 17 times the value of December 2017’s ATH in around another 191 days? Which would put Bitcoin price at around $333,000 by 1 Jan 2020. So, maybe a bit late for Christmas then, but it would be churlish to grumble for the sake of a week. What price will Bitcoin achieve by Christmas this year? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Cole Kenelly  ","['bitcoin price', 'Bitcoin Rally', 'hodlmoon']"

Over the past 24 hours, it is in fact Tether supplying the majority of Bitcoin buy-ins, with $4.21 billion changing hands between the two cryptocurrencies.  Second is Ethereum, which saw $1.62 billion within the same period. The US dollar, on the other hand, produced around $1.16 billion, according to Coinlib.   As BTC/USD circles $12,500, theories are mounting as to how Bitcoin gained so much so quickly, and where the trajectory is likely to aim for next.  Despite Bitcoin, in general, reappearing in mainstream consciousness, the inflow data makes for interesting interpretations about just who is buying it.  One possible theory revolves around the idea that old hands are at work. Tether and Ether holders could be extending profits, while entry-level users – those who have not previously owned cryptocurrency – remain on the sidelines.  Such a scenario would place 2019’s bull run phase in contrast with the previous one from 2017 when it was mainstream consumers who appeared gripped by ‘FOMO’ – or ‘fear of missing out.’ “All data that we have indicates that the current #bitcoin rally is being driven by (crypto traders) who are already familiar with the market,” Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at UK-based platform eToro, commented on the findings Wednesday. “…Question is, will the newbies pick up the baton and blow us past the (all-time high)?” Alternatively, Asia – and particularly China – could lie at the heart of the enthusiasm.  As Bitcoinist previously reported, China’s lockdown on purchasing cryptocurrency has resulted in traders employing evermore ingenious ways of getting exposure to the market.  Tether, commentators previously suggested, formed their major onramp, functioning as a middleman between the yuan and BTC.  Should that theory be valid, it would also explain the large volumes between Tether and Bitcoin.  Data from South Korea, where consumers are paying a premium for Bitcoin on exchanges in fiat terms, would also corroborate the concept.   Known as the ‘Kimchi Premium,’ the phenomenon has historically appeared during bullish phases for Bitcoin, with this month being no different. On Upbit, a major trading platform, BTC/USD in Korean won terms has already passed $13,000.  A third idea, revolving around long-awaited institutional investor involvement, may be set to influence markets in the near future. With Bitcoin futures already showing record volumes, the launch of Bakkt’s futures offering in July has already been compared to the first moon landing.  What do you think about inflows into Bitcoin this week?

Since then the company has been collecting data and responses to its Bitcoin-based stock and ETF platform. Findings have been positive emphasizing a strong demand for convenient and affordable investing solutions. The concept is simple but effective. Enable Bitcoin as a medium for stock and ETF trading for non-US customers. Since its launch in late May to over 150 countries, Abra has eased the process of stock trading and decentralized access to financial services, and on-boarded active users in 82 countries. The app allows customers to invest in stocks such as Tesla, Uber, Alibaba, and Facebook, in addition to ETFs like the gold SPDR, with Bitcoin. In a series of tweets, the company revealed a few statistics about the first month of product usage around the world. 1/ A few weeks ago, Abra launched stock and ETF investing for users (outside the US) using #bitcoin.

Abra claims that 43% of its users stated that Bitcoin has made investing in financial markets more accessible while 35% said they can now afford to invest in popular stocks, thanks to fractional investing. CEO and founder of Abra, Bill Barhydt, was overwhelmed by the response to the product, telling Bitcoin Magazine: “We opened our waitlist in February and only just launched the product for general availability to Abra international customers at the end of May, so it’s only been live for a few weeks. In just a few weeks, we have nearly 14,000 equity wallets in the system from 154 countries around the globe and growing.” The survey revealed that the most popular stock investors wanted since the product was launched was Tesla. 3/ So what happens when you enable the world to turn $BTC into stocks?

The median investment in Tesla is also a lot higher than that invested elsewhere on the platform. Barhydt attributed this to millennial investors adding: “We think this is a reflection of the new millennial investor that puts their money where their beliefs are. And it’s clear they believe in the vision that Elon Musk is building,” The top five countries going big on Tesla are Musk’s home nation of South Africa, France, Argentina, Austria, and the Philippines.

Use a Hardware Wallet', '2. Go Completely Mobile', '3. Try Timelocking Your Bitcoin', 'Take the Time to Store Your Bitcoin Safely']","  Christina Comben | Jun 25, 2019 | 14:00 With the price of Bitcoin on a tearing run right now, it’s more important than ever to think about the long-term security of your funds – if you haven’t done so already. Here’s a list of the best ways to keep your crypto safe. Enough with entrusting your private keys to a cryptocurrency exchange or an insecure hot wallet. If you own any amount of Bitcoin, it’s gaining in value. That will make naturally make it a bigger target for the hackers.  With more than $1.2 billion being stolen from crypto exchange hacks and fraud in the first quarter of 2019 alone, it’s time to wake up and smell the coffee before it’s too late. Check out these top three ways to store your Bitcoin safely. Stop relying on the convenience of exchanges to transact. Hardware crypto wallets have come a long way since the start. Versions like the Ledger Nano X, for example, sync with your smartphone and mean you can transact on the go without the need for a computer.  It doesn’t compromise your security since your private keys and seed never leave your device. Bluetooth only transports public data.  Trezor doesn’t have that function but its touch screen provides a simpler user experience. If you want a wallet fit for a rockstar, check out the chunky GRAY Trezor Corazon to make you feel like a million bucks–while making sure your fortune is safe from opportune hackers.  The CoolWallet S from CoolBit X is a credit-card sized, bluetooth-enabled cold storage device, combined with built-in hot wallet features to provide a more on-the-go solution for crypto traders. The device is both waterproof and heat resistant, not to mention super secure.  Another alternative if you don’t like the idea of investing in a hardware wallet is to go completely mobile. Try downloading a Bitcoin wallet like Mycelium, which is available for both iOS and Android.  The UX on this wallet isn’t great. But still less of a headache than using a Ledger or Trezor and worth it for the additional security over an exchange.  Note, Mycelium isn’t a cold wallet. However, it is known for its security, and you get to keep your Bitcoin in your pocket at all times. Not for the beginner, there is a series of steps that you have to take if you want to timelock your Bitcoin. There are also some major advantages (and disadvantages) of doing this. Think of a timelock as one of those savings accounts or trust funds that you can’t touch until a certain date. You basically set up a smart contract that prevents you from spending your Bitcoin. The advantages of this are that your Bitcoin is safely locked into a smart contract which no one can access without the private keys.  It also stops you from selling your Bitcoin when the market rallies, as Lucas Nuzzi mentioned below:  Most of my BTC is time-locked so that I have to wait every time I want to move larger balances. The original motivation was security, but this has become a great investment tool. It prevents me from trying to time and trade short-term rallies, and has saved me a lot of money. — Lucas Nuzzi (@LucasNuzzi) June 22, 2019  Obviously, though, this could also be a disadvantage if you seriously need to access your BTC and want to cash out. Yes, it’s easier to keep your BTC on an exchange if you’re not a computer person and find the whole wallet experience nauseating. But you’ll get a far sicker feeling if a hacker seizes your funds or the exchange goes belly up. There are other solutions that let you earn interest rather than just HODLing your BTC. But be sure to check them out thoroughly and be prepared to store your Bitcoin with a third party. What do you make of this list? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!

Analyst Alex Krüger tweeted on Monday (June 24, 2019) that bitcoin could be overbought over the next 18 days, based on an analysis of the Keltner Channel indicator – which provides information of price/trend breakouts and if an asset is overbought or oversold. Is $BTC overbought? Since 2014, $BTC has traded fully outside the Keltner Channel (2.5/20) with RSI >90 on NINE occasions. ▷ 6/9 times retraced to the open of preceding day in under 20 days (avg 10d). ▷ 1/9 times it took 79 days. ▷ 2/9 times it never retraced (May 2017).

On seven out of the nine previous occasions, BTC experienced a price retrace. The market analyst also revealed that over the 20 days following the time when BTC enters this overbought position, bitcoin prices declined by an average of 12.5%. Going by this trend, we could expect to see BTC fall just under $10k by July 13. A decline in mid-July to August would be in keeping with historical trends that show the latter part of Summer as having the least annualized monthly returns for bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently having its third upward trend towards the mid-$11k region and beyond. The top-ranked cryptocurrency has faced resistance at this level on the two previous occasions and this third run presents a temporary moment of truth. Breaking above $11,500 could pave the way for an unimpeded run towards the $13,000 mark. However, failing to cross this resistant point will most likely trigger a “mini dump” back to the previous support level somewhere in the $10,200 to $10,300 price levels. If Keltner Channel indicator is indeed accurate and BTC is currently overbought, then the bullish advanced might be a little fatigued at the current price. There also the matter of a second CME gap which if closed might cause a price drop back to the same $10k price mark. All of these possible price retrace scenarios only constitute a temporary blip in short-term performance. The overarching bullish narrative is still in effect for bitcoin.  Data from Google Trends shows that search interest for bitcoin is at a similar level to the start of the FOMO-driven hype market of September and October 2017. This could mean a rekindling of retail interest in the top-ranked crypto given the 205% increase since the start of 2019.

Cannabis: The Grass Is Always Greener', 'Opportunities Sprouting']","  Anja van Oosterhout | Jun 25, 2019 | 10:00 Bitcoin’s latest moonshot to a new 15-month high has not just left the gold market in its dust, but also the nascent cannabis market.  Data comparing Bitcoin price 00 with the global cannabis market, confirms a trend which will likely bring enthusiasts back down to Earth. The emerging cannabis market, which Bloomberg described as ‘the next big thing‘ earlier this year, has started wilting over the last quarter while the price of BTC keeps getting higher. This week, the trend came to the attention of Todd Harrison, the CIO and founding partner of CB1 Capital. CB1 Capital is an investment advisory company which focuses exclusively on cannabinoid-based solutions. Bitcoin vs 🌎 #cannabis $XBT $BTC pic.twitter.com/HeE9Aq4VRW — Todd Harrison (@todd_harrison) June 25, 2019  Despite being an obvious bull for medical cannabis and the associated relaxation of regulations surrounding the industry, even Harrison appeared keen to highlight Bitcoin’s attractive performance compared to the BIGLCBCP index.  As of June 25, the latter was trailing at $177, having reached $230 in March. At the same time, BTC/USD continues to expand, as Bitcoinist reported, reaching 15-month highs over $11,350 Monday.  “May was a sloppy month for the cannabis complex, as evidenced by the 15% decline in the BI Global Cannabis Competitive Peers Index,” Harrison wrote about the current cannabis price in a blog post published June 18.  “We have been told that there was forced selling, or liquidation, in the cannabis space during the month, which squares with the price action.” Not everyone agrees. In February, as Bitcoin still languished around $4000, consultancy CEO Carol Pepper told CNBC that cannabis was the “next huge growth area” and that this growth would not mirror the boom-and-bust cycle of Bitcoin markets. “If you want to be in something that’s very growthy, and actually legitimate as it is legalized and controlled properly, I think this is the place to go,” she said. That prophecy had in fact already come true half a year previously. Against a background of increasing regulatory tolerance of cannabis, it should be recalled that the industry has traditionally had a close relationship with cryptocurrency.  That setup is continuing this year, Bitcoinist noting in May that a Hong Kong investment firm had pivoted to the cannabis market as a way of diversifying its crypto-focused portfolio. “Both blockchain and industrial cannabis are the future, and both are embraced by the younger generation,” co-chairman Yao Yongjie commented to the press at the time.  As Harrison meanwhile noted, the plant-based market remains in its very infancy, even compared with the ten-year-old Bitcoin. There may thus well be room for the kind of exponential growth long-time HODLers have witnessed since 2009; as Bitcoinist pointed out, since the first prices went live, BTC/USD has delivered returns in excess of 700,000,000%.

Just HODL for long enough and reap the rewards.. But what if you want to do more?  Trading requires a greater understanding of the market and its various metrics, but sometimes analysts just seem to be speaking an alien language. So how are you supposed to know your CV-DD from your NVT Cap? Thankfully, crypto-analyst Adam Taché compiled some handy guides, which we’ll go through in this, and its companion off-chain metrics article. The ‘Realised Cap’ metric addresses deficiencies in using pure market cap when dealing with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Market cap, formed as the product of current price * current supply, does not take into account lost, unclaimed, or unspendable coins. Instead, Realised Cap sums the value of each coin the last time it moved. Therefore, lost coins and those which have been out of circulation for some time are not valued at current prices. Of course, one issue is that this cannot differentiate between truly lost coins and those in deep cold storage. Although we can consider these long-term hodl’ed coins as equivalent to lost until they move (are found). The ‘Realised Price’ is a volume-weighted average price (VWAP), which approximates the average price paid for circulating BTC. To understand ‘Balanced Price’ (and the following Cumulative Value-Days Destroyed), we need to understand the concept of ‘CoinDays Destroyed‘. CoinDays Destroyed (CDD) is a volume metric which gives more weight to coins based on how long they have been held. A CoinDay is created when 1 bitcoin is not moved for one day. If that 1 BTC is finally moved after 100 days, then it has built up 100 CoinDays and the transaction will result in 100 CDD. If it is then immediately moved again, that will cause zero additional CoinDays Destroyed, Using this we can calculate Transferred Price, which uses supply to bring CDD into the Bitcoin price domain and can be considered as a moving average of price spent. It takes the summation of all CDD multiplied by price (at time of destruction), and divides this by the market age (in days) multiplied by current supply. The Balanced Price is the Realised Price (avg. paid) minus the Transferred Price (avg. spent), and aims to be a ‘fair’ valuation measure. During bear markets, when bitcoin price falls to this level, it is a good indication that full-detox has been achieved. i.e. the market is about to turn. ‘Cumulative Value-days Destroyed’ (CVDD) is another approach to bring CDD into the price domain. It is calculated in exactly the same way as Transferred Price, but with one slight difference. Instead of using supply (which increases over time) as a divisor, it uses the constant value of 6,000,000. This is an arbitrary figure used to calibrate the chart, and would be different if the market age (time since genesis block) was measured in hours or blocks rather than days. With this calibration, CVDD hits historical price bottoms in 2011, 2015, and 2018, with incredible accuracy. Both CVDD and Balanced Price are explained in more detail here. ‘Delta Cap’ is another Bitcoin metric devised to catch market bottoms and predict new bull runs. It is calculated as the Realised Cap minus the Average Cap (simple moving average to date). ‘Top Cap’ metric is a simple metric comprising the Average Cap multiplied by 35. It has been very efficient at hitting global market ‘tops’ to date, and when used in conjunction with CVDD provides upper and lower bands for price action.  ‘Thermo Cap’ is used as a proxy to measure inflow of capital into Bitcoin. It is the sum of coinbase tx rewards at the price that they were mined, and represents the cumulative security spend by the network. Finally, the ‘Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio’ is a measure of Bitcoin’s monetary velocity. It is determined as the market cap (network value) divided by the daily USD value transmitted through the blockchain. As Bitcoin is a store of value network, volume represents investor flows. As such NVT Ratio is roughly analogous to the Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio used in equity markets. It can give a good indication of whether Bitcoin is under or over-valued. Many of these metrics are experimental, and although they seem to accurately chart past performance, cannot be relied on for future predictions. However, they are certainly a useful tool for analysing the market and its cycles. All of these metrics can be charted and studied on the Woobull Charts website from Woonomics. The next article in this series will look at some of the off-chain indicators used by analysts, which are largely derived from these on-chain valuation models. Feel smarter already?

At these levels, investors are working with a Bitcoin price of $14,640.  The premium, which amounts to around 30 percent, is not new but has increased significantly as Bitcoin cements its position in the latest three-month-long bull run.  At one point, GBTC traded above $15 at a 40 percent premium, leading to suggestions that substantial upward market moves were still on the horizon. “Big money coming in!” one popular online trader summarized on Monday linking to the data. $BTC big move might be coming.. $GBTC is trading at a 40% premium right now.

While the talk is now turning to concerns that, Bitcoin could be overbought under current conditions, Barry Silbert, founder of Grayscale, remains upbeat about the near-term options.  “($20,000) is a magnet,” he summarized about Bitcoin’s price potential on social media before the weekend.  Nevertheless, he agreed with Lee’s recent analysis suggesting BTC/USD could be making its most decisive move for a while.  “This week’s strong move on (cryptocurrency) and especially (Bitcoin) is a reminder $BTC historically generates its annual performance in 10 days. Miss those 10 days and average return is -25%,” he wrote.  In an interview with Bloomberg meanwhile, Silbert remained decisively bullish.  “We’ve been through quite a rollercoaster; the price has gone down 80 percent four times, but in the past four times, the price has hit record highs afterwards,” he told the network June 12. “If you look at the price chart for Bitcoin, it looks like perhaps we’re coming out of the crypto winter, and that we’ve entered the crypto spring.” What do you think about GBTC’s price?

Bitcoin is no different; however the groups of those against it, probably because they don’t comprehend it, are starting to emerge from their caves hollering about bubbles once again. We heard it all before in 2017; ‘Bitcoin is a bubble that will burst’. Granted, BTC did fall over 80% the following year but has since recovered back to just 45% in the past few months. Since its bottom of $3,200 in mid-December, bitcoin has made over 250% to current levels and does not look like stopping there. Naturally, its energetic performance over the past few months has riled the rafts of those that still hold the opinion that BTC is a speculative bubble. American libertarian, stockbroker, financial commentator, and radio personality, Peter Schiff, is one of that ilk. Schiff is bullish on gold but frequently bashes its digital equivalent, Bitcoin. In a recent tweet, Schiff once again said that Bitcoin was a bubble and that this is a ‘sucker’s rally’. “I’ve witnessed several asset bubbles over the years and those trapped inside also say foolish things to rationalize the price rise. But none more foolish than what’s being said to rationalize the Bitcoin bubble.  The bigger the bubble, the more foolish one must be not to see it!” I’ve witnessed several asset bubbles over the years and those trapped inside also say foolish things to rationalize the price rise.  But none more foolish than what’s being said to rationalize the Bitcoin bubble.  The bigger the bubble, the more foolish one must be not to see it! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 24, 2019  The outspoken chairman of commodity investment firm, SchiffGold, echoes the sentiments of many aging American traditionalists that only believe in their own investments. If Bitcoin is a bubble then gold must be considered one also since it is still down around 25% from its peak in 2011. The crypto community did not take this lying down and the responses came thick and fast. One commented “My dude, you have been saying this since BTC was $16. Not $1,600 or $16,000, but literally $16.” Another chimed in with “I’m sure you remember the gold bubble back in 2011 right? That one still hasn’t recovered 8 years later.” The most pertinent, however, was an infographic depicting the ‘bubble’ in action, time and time again plotted on a logarithmic chart.  Another renowned Bitcoin basher and perma-bear, Nouriel Roubini, has also been uncharacteristically quiet regarding BTC recently as it surged back above five figures. There are many that simply do not understand Bitcoin and they tend to be in the latter years of their lives and bought up on traditional investment vehicles such as stock markets, real estate or commodities. It can be said that BTC is pretty speculative at the moment as it has yet to be fully embraced as a global currency. Considering that is a spec compared to the multi-trillion dollar gold or stock markets, and is even smaller than some US tech companies in terms of market cap, Bitcoin still has a long way to go.

Ira Kleiman alleges that Wright stole a sum of bitcoins that the latter mined with his brother during the earliest years of Bitcoin. Commenting on the matter is Daniel Kelman, a lawyer licensed in New York, a foreign-registered lawyer in Taiwan, and a solicitor licensed in Hong Kong, who claims to have been in private practice focused on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related matters since 2013. Apparently, in the above lawsuit, the court had ordered Craig Wright to produce a list of the bitcoin addresses where David Kleiman and himself held the cryptocurrency. Wright argued that this is impossible as those bitcoins were placed into a “blind trust” back in 2011 and that he doesn’t have access to it. That’s because the trust requires him to contact a number of different trustees who are unreachable for various reasons. The court, however, has issued an order on June 14th which indicates that it believes that Craig Wright does, indeed, have the power to contact these trustees and, hence, access the trust. It had ordered a hearing scheduled for June 28th as to whether or not Wright should be held in contempt of court for actually failing to produce the addresses in question. Needless to say, contempt of court is a very powerful remedy which allows judges to ensure that litigants comply with the court’s rules. The lawyer argues that it’s Kleiman’s strategy to expose that Wright is not trustworthy, which is also something that puts his claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto to the test. However, Kelman also says that the real strategy that is pursued by Kleiman is to seek a confidential settlement from Wright for an amount less than that sought in court, leveraging their ability to expose him as a fraud. In essence, pay me or get exposed. – Says the lawyer. Naturally, the outcome of the case between Kleiman and Wright could impact a more recent trial between Bitcoin SV’s proponent and popular cryptocurrency Youtuber Peter McCormack. The latter was recently served with a GBP100,000 libel claim from Craig Wright. McCormack has since decided to pursue the matter in court and going all the way against CSW. However, both cases are held under different jurisdictions as Wright vs McCormack is in the UK, while the other case is in the US. Regardless, if Kleiman fails to reach a settlement (or if that’s not his strategy) and goes on to expose Wright’s trustworthiness, this could probably have serious consequences on his further trials where he claims that he’s the real Satoshi Nakamoto. What do you think of CSW’s claims that he’s Satoshi Nakamoto? Don’t hesitate to let us know in the comments below!

Is this an early indication that Bitcoin could be next? Let’s take a look.  It’s a well-known fact now that Tether’s circulating supply has a direct, albeit delayed, impact on Bitcoin price 00. Its inflation back in 2017 is still widely believed to be the root cause of the crypto boom that sparked off between November to December, at the time.   Whenever more Tether (USDT) enter the market, it’s commonplace to see BTC’s performance spike a short while later, and vice versa. This effect can be seen on the chart above on several occasions, where Tether’s rising and falling market capital has subsequently shaped the #1 cryptocurrency’s performance over the last 12 months.   What’s interesting with this correlating trend right now is that Tether’s meteoric rise appears to be stalling. For the first time in over a month, there’s a bearish divergence on the MACD indicator with increasing selling volume on the histogram.   The RSI is also exhibiting bearish signals, as the indicator line starts to print increasingly lower highs.   With these signs pointing towards a reversal, it seems likely – given the historical relationship between these two cryptocurrencies – that Bitcoin’s moonshot could also be about to make a downward turn also.    We have been following gaps in the CME Bitcoin Futures market closely over the last 4 weeks, and have already commented on their similar magnet-like effects on pulling Bitcoin’s price in certain directions.   Last week, Bitcoinist reported that a new $570 CME gap had appeared on the CME BTC1! Chart which was threatening to pull BTC down towards $8,500. Now, we can see that a new gap has emerged after a second weekend of heightened bullish trading activity on the derivative market.   This second gap, which represents a $580 difference in price between the weekend close and the new weekly open price, is now threatening to drag Bitcoin back down towards the psychological $10,000.   The real worry here is that one gap closing could lead to the next being closed in quick succession. The sudden drop in price would not only trigger panic selling, but would also likely cause a serious long squeeze. Together, these two contributory factors along with the gaps closing, could dramatically extend Bitcoin’s anticipated correction from it’s new 13-month high.   From here, the only way is up – if Bitcoin is to avoid this potentially dangerous reversal. Which way do you think Bitcoin is headed over the coming weeks?

As CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) confirmed on social media June 24, the pilot scheme delivered its first liquidation – likely painful for those involved – on a Bitcoin 00 short.  Bitcoin price continues to fluctuate at press time Monday, having reached over $11,300 on some exchanges before correcting downwards below $10,600. Significant price moves can prove highly costly for margin traders, with the world’s leading crypto exchange choosing to steer clear of the sought-after, yet potentially dangerous, tool until now.  The fate of margin trading accounts on global exchange giant BitMEX, frequently makes for a point of debate on cryptocurrency social media, with data showing the extent of users’ gains and losses.  Zhao used the occasion of the first liquidation to remind followers to behave responsibly with their capital.  “Don’t bet against bitcoin, and don’t bet [against] b…” he wrote on Twitter, which serves as both a warning to inexperienced traders who might be considering margin trading, as well as a suggestion to his followers to long Bitcoin. The final part of his comment is most likely referring to his platform’s own native currency, Binance Coin (BNB), as a reminder to support that token too. The pilot currently involves several thousand Binance users, with officials opting to open up participation to holders of its in-house token, Binance Coin (BNB) 00, earlier this month via an early access scheme. BNB has gone from strength to strength in June, delivering a new all-time high of just under $40. This week, Binance confirmed trading support for its native Binance Chain stablecoin, USDSB, issued by StableUSD. Previously, the exchange announced it was issuing BTCB on Binance Chain, a token pegged to Bitcoin. Binance’s recently-launched decentralized exchange, Binance DEX, will also likely facilitate trading. A blog post issued June 17 read, The main benefit of offering crypto-pegged tokens is that, obviously, this makes available to Binance DEX traders the many coins that have their own blockchains and aren’t native on Binance Chain  It went on to say, With the increase in the selection of tokens available on Binance DEX, there should be an increase in trading volume and liquidity, This would further increase the utility value of Binance DEX. As Bitcoinist reported, with regulatory questions affecting all cryptocurrency traders, Binance nonetheless has taken the decision to exclude US users from certain aspects of its platform.  Ahead of the upcoming G20 summit, cryptocurrency businesses are scheduled to meet with intergovernmental organization the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in order to clarify recommendations which many say will place impossible demands on them.

And it does not disappoint.   Just when you thought this month couldn’t get any better for Bitcoin, along comes a new crypto-centric Pokemon parody with a powerful message. The parody theme tune of the famous children’s cartoon programme arrived on Youtube earlier this week, just in time to capitalize on the renewed cryptocurrency hype. The song is written and performed by the original theme tune singer, Jason Paige, who we can only assume is a devoted bitcoin-maximalist judging by the parody’s carefully crafted lyrics. Despite being a parody, the song surprisingly manages to incorporate almost all of bitcoin’s angles, including mining, electronic payments and decentralization. I wanna pay with the very best… Like no one ever has. To mine them is our real test… To use them is our cause. Bit will travel across the land… And all decentralized. Just use Bitcoin to understand… The power that’s inside. He goes on to call Bitcoin our destiny, not just a currency, and mentions its global and peer-to-peer nature. There is even reference to the Bitcoin network’s ‘trustless’ nature – “A network to trust so true. The block-chain will pull us through.” Some of Paige’s most cutting lyrics regard the impact of Bitcoin on the banks and financial authorities. Picture a kid brought up on Pokemon, who now feels completely disenfranchised because adult life is not all about keeping virtual creatures in strange eggs with which to do battle. With this new parody, Paige has made Bitcoin sound like an attractive alternative; keeping virtual money in hardware wallets to battle the tyranny of the financial system. While the video has only received around 4,000 views (at the time of writing), the response from the crypto community has been highly positive.

This month alone Bitcoin has surged 26% from mid $8000 to over $10,000. With political and economic tensions rising, BTC has often been compared to gold as a store of value but, which one is superior? The weekend has been nothing short of monumental for Bitcoin. Yesterday BTC hit a new 2019 and 15 month high of $11,250 as it’s market cap touched $200 billion. Since then top crypto asset has cooled off a little. It is now back at $10,700 it’s latest traded value for the past day or so. The huge pump has resulted in mass speculation as to why BTC is doing so well at the moment. Political and economic tensions across the globe are on the rise. This has driven people towards safer, offshore investments such as gold and Bitcoin. BTC was being traded at a premium during the recent protests in Hong Kong. This is a prime example of where citizens will look when under threat from governments and banks. Gold prices have surged recently and since the beginning of the year, the commodity is up almost 10 percent. The recent spike to $1400 has sent gold to a six-year high. This is a sign that confidence in fiat currencies and traditional investments such as stocks is falling. Bitcoin has also surged recently and is up a whopping 185 percent since January first. However, there is a primary difference between gold and Bitcoin. BTC has pure monetary value whereas gold has an industrial demand in addition to its value as a store of wealth. “The vast majority of gold’s price is monetary premium, just like Bitcoin. Industrial use does not protect that premium in any way. The premium is based on suitability as a store of value where Bitcoin excels over even gold.” The vast majority of gold's price is monetary premium, just like Bitcoin.

Escalating trade wars and geopolitical oppression by so-called “superpowers” is on the rise. This is only going to turn more people towards safe-haven assets such as Bitcoin and gold.

Binance CEO, CZ, posted a tweet this week commenting on India’s latest anti-bitcoin bill, which seeks to dish out jail sentences to anybody caught holding cryptocurrencies. The more it is ""banned"", the more people want it. https://t.co/weOVZGCaz3 — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) June 22, 2019  The head of the world’s largest centralised crypto exchange argued that the newly proposed changes to ban cryptocurrencies will only serve to make “more people want it”. This has become increasingly evident over the last couple of days, as Bitcoin’s spot price on Bitbns platform – one of the few remaining bitcoin exchanges in India – has been reportedly trading at around $11,120 . This price is more than $500 higher than the average BTC price in other markets across the world, and is currently $450 higher than Binance’s BTC spot price. This substantial premium compared to the rest of the market highlights the overwhelming demand for BTC in the country. Premiums aren’t a strange occurrence for cryptocurrencies in general, and only last week a $160 Bitcoin premium was identified on a Hong Kong exchange, Tidebit, as reported by Bitcoinist.  But the situation in India is particularly peculiar, given the government’s increasing anti-crypto stance. With fewer avenues to purchase bitcoin, the increasing scarcity and rising demand appear to be rocketing up prices.  Bitcoin continues to be the poster child for a real life manifestation of the Streisand effect – where the more people that try to suppress it, the greater it grows. Despite numerous efforts from Indian lawmakers to restrict cryptocurrency adoption in the country, it appears the appeal of the top-ranked cryptocurrency hasn’t stopped growing. This broadening appeal has even moved beyond retail speculation into mainstream institutional adoption. But why would there be an increase in demand for BTC in India? Well, the country’s government has stepped up its capital control policies in a bid to protect the Indian Rupee (INR). However, with the country’s rising debt profile and growing inflation, the exact opposite of the desired outcome in terms of INR stability seems to be the case. Bitcoin, therefore, constitutes a haven currency for Indians to store wealth in case the INR loses value significantly. Indians do not have easy access to cryptocurrencies in general. The country’s central bank banned commercial banks from facilitating transactions for exchanges back in 2018 so platforms have no access to fiat. Despite a vigorous challenge instituted against the policy, the Supreme Court has yet to reach any verdict. Banks have even gone further to close down the accounts of customers engaged in cryptocurrency trading. The emerging digital crackdown even goes beyond bitcoin with reports of platforms like Telegram and Reddit being blocked in the country. Some banks have even reportedly ceased offering support for PayPal payments. India is even preparing to pass a law that completely bans all forms of cryptocurrency activity in the country. This new law will reportedly prohibit the trading, holding, and mining of cryptocurrency. Anyone caught in contravention of the law would face a 10-year prison sentence without the possibility of parole. Such a move would even place India above China in terms of anti-crypto regulations. Projects like Facebook’s Libra might not be allowed to operate in India given the country’s banking laws which prohibit banking networks from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. Crypto stakeholders in India say the government’s stance will only drive the industry underground. Will Modi’s government be able to ban bitcoin completely in India?

Most notably, bitcoin price broke through the psychological $10k mark; a level which we haven’t seen in over 15 months. So how did it get there? Well the first step was to hold onto and consolidate the price gains of last weekend. This achieved, focus turned to breaking through resistance at $9300, and where the next target would be. $10,000 was the obvious contender to aim for, but the meteoric gains of last Sunday left a CME gap that the bears might try to close. The feared drop never materialised however, and towards the end of the week further gains were made on the back of huge bullish signals. This left the price in a rising wedge pattern towards $10k, and the weekend saw a breakout, leading to the $10,600 levels we currently see. The week’s gains saw analysts pulling out their prediction pads once again. Tyler Winklevoss suggested that once $10k fell there was little to stop a further price rise to $15k. Tom Lee from Fundstrat doubled down on his prediction, claiming that $40k was in play over the next few months. Some analysts looking at the ‘bigger picture’ even started to eye $100k, if previous market cycles play out as before. Even before the gains of the past week, Bitcoin had overtaken Russia’s monetary base, making it the eighth largest currency in the world. Political unrest in Hong Kong saw bitcoin trading with a $175 premium in the territory, as investors attempted to reduce exposure. Continued hyper-inflation in Venezuela saw record levels of BTC traded on LocalBitcoins once again. And in the UK, no-deal Brexit fears following the latest stage of the Conservative leadership contest to decide a new Prime Minister, also saw investors moving away from assets in pounds sterling. News about Facebook’s Libra project has been hard to avoid this week, being splashed across even mainstream media. The official launch was on Tuesday, with the website crashing just moments later. Within hours the backlash had begun; Libra’s ‘brazen attempt to override national monetary sovereignty’ led to predictions it would be shut-down by governments. France decided a G7 task-force was needed in wake of the launch, to define what a stablecoin is, how stable, and against what. Fundstrat was less concerned, claiming that the token will primarily be used to buy bitcoin anyway. There was even a claim that the logo wasn’t exactly original! The one place Libra did seem to find some love was China. Let’s see what the Chinese government have to say about that. The latest court-ordered report into QuadrigaCX and its ‘dead’ CEO, Gerald Cotten, was published this week. It contained damning claims of embezzled funds, fraudulent activity, and careless margin trading. How many times do we have to tell people… Not your keys, not your crypto. Best week ever for crypto?

One of them is increasingly gaining prominence: The U.S. Federal Reserve. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest moves might be unintentionally propelling Bitcoin to new 2019 highs with renewed impetus. On Jun 19, 2019, Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed announced the decision to maintain the benchmark for the federal funds interest rate within the target range of 2.25% to 2.5%.  However, upon review of the statement, financial experts noticed that The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made several changes to its policy statement. Most relevant, the term “patient” was replaced by a policy language promising to “closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.” For many, this is a hint that inflation and geopolitical risks are putting pressure on Federal Reserve officials to advance the case for an interest rate cut. As a result, investors on the trading floors are already betting that the Fed will lower the rates as soon as July, putting the dollar under pressure. In contrast, investors believe that a Fed rate cut would propel Bitcoin and gold to higher values. For example, according to CNN digital correspondent Paul La Monica, That has been viewed as a positive for bitcoin as well as gold, which are looked at as alternative currencies that should rally when central banks take actions that reduce the value of government-backed currencies. Moreover, Central Bankers perspective about Bitcoin might be shifting from a negative to a more positive outlook. Last week, both Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his counterpart Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, reportedly advised that central banks “should look at bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with an open mind,” writes La Monica. Moreover, Carney has made it clear that he favors imposing strict controls. At a conference organized by the European Central Bank in Portugal, referring to cryptocurrencies, Carney pointed out, “Anything that works in this world, will become instantly systemic and will have to be subject to the highest standards of regulations,” More regulations, according to La Monica, would bring benefits to the crypto markets, by smoothing Bitcoin’s volatility and helping to further validate Bitcoin’s legitimacy in global financial markets. In addition to a Fed rate cut in July and a weak dollar, another key factor affecting the financial markets and Bitcoin, in particular, is, as the Fed statement put it, “uncertainty.” Given the ongoing Brexit upheaval, China/U.S. trade war, Hong Kong demonstrations, and the Middle East rising tensions, gold and Bitcoin are moving to the foreground as safe-haven assets. Bitcoin takes aim at $100,000 target. $btcusd is experiencing its fourth parabolic phase dating back to 2010.

In an exclusive chat with Bitcoinist, Hill provided his thoughts on the recent BTC price spike 00. According to Hill, the present trend mirrors the 2017 bull run meaning bitcoin could be set for a new all-time high (ATH). Elaborating further, the Obsidian Capital partner commented: Bitcoin has blown past a significant resistance at the $9000 price mark. With order books across exchanges so thin, it proves that funds and institutions have been accumulating $BTC near the lows. The Price of $BTC has been able to move up thousands within a 1-2 timeframe, reminiscent of the 2017 bull run. Given the increase in institutional adoption cases related to bitcoin in 2019 alone, there is a growing sense of the top-ranked cryptocurrency becoming a more mature asset. Much of the price trend commentary offered by stakeholders in the industry so far point to institutional traders being behind the price surge since April 1.  For Hill, the question for analysts at the present time would be the new price top for this current uptrend. With bitcoin primed for another parabolic advance, the top-ranked cryptocurrency could set a new ATH. Commenting on this possibility, Hill opined: Bitcoin Average Dormancy Theory, an on-chain metric which simply described is the analysis of movement and destruction of Bitcoin along with Dormancy Flow theory, developed by David Puell, shows $BTC this month crossing a pivotal Bull/Bear Threshold. This indicates to me that we are in the full grip of a new cycle, the question is for many will now be finding the top. With so much emphasis on the mid-$6k to the mid-$7k range as possible retracement levels, Hill believes there lies little resistance on BTC’s advance to equaling the previous ATH of $19,800. In 2017, BTC rose from $7,000 to $20,000 within the space of three weeks. Thus, traders going for short bets might rue such a decision given the overwhelmingly bullish sentiment that pervades the market at the moment. The current momentum seems to favor a bullish advance which could mean bitcoin shorts getting liquidated in a series of squeezes. Hill believes bitcoin can reach between $45,000 to $55,000 within the next 12 to 18 months. By the 2020 halving, the total BTC supply should be about 18.4 million BTC which would put its market capitalization at between $828 billion and $1 trillion. Gold has a market capitalization of about $7.5 trillion. The bitcoin market valued at more than $1 trillion would put to bed any contention of BTC’s store of value (SoV) status. On the subject of the recently announced Libra, Hill doesn’t expect Facebook’s crypto project to affect bitcoin. Instead, the Obsidian Capital partner expects Libra to be bullish for bitcoin in the long-term. According to Hill: I think that the rise of Libra and the potential exposure and new adoption that this could bring, is enough to prove to many that the unique decentralized properties of blockchain are valid, and the old monetary system is now being threatened by a global player attempting to supersede the old system with a new form of decentralized currency. Bitcoin is currently approaching the $11,000 mark, up more than 10% in the last 24-hour trading period. The top-ranked crypto has gained close to 200% since the start of 2019.

Whilst he claims that he is ‘not aiming for no deal’, he insists that the threat of it is a vital negotiating tool. Although, Boris hasn’t actually said much more than that about his Brexit plan, just that he has a ‘credible’ one. But the EU are adamant that the currently offered deal and October 31 deadline are non-negotiable, save for a second referendum or general election. Fears around the ramifications of Brexit have been pushing down the value of the pounds since the June 2016 referendum result. Johnson’s promise to leave ‘deal or no-deal’ isn’t helping matters, according to Nigel Green of financial advisory group, deVere in conversation with Forbes: As [Boris] Johnson’s campaign moves up a gear–as it moves into the next phase to win over the party’s grassroots–we can expect him to also up his hard Brexit rhetoric and this will likely drive sterling even lower He went on to continue, We are already seeing that U.K. and international investors in U.K. assets are responding to the Brexit-fuelled uncertainties by considering removing their wealth from the U.K… One such way that many are looking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against legitimate risks posed by Brexit is by investing in crypto assets, such as bitcoin. As we have seen in countries with longstanding financial uncertainty such as Argentina, and more recently, following unrest in Hong Kong, the influence of international politics and stock market upheavals on Bitcoin is increasing. Certainly, today’s news that bitcoin price has broken through the $10,000 mark, would seem to attest to that. So, while the British sterling braces itself for a potentially turbulent next few months as Boris Johnson edges closer towards 10 Downing Street, be thankful that you stocked up on bitcoin while prices were low. You did stock up on bitcoin while prices were low, didn’t you? What do you think of Nigel Green’s predictions? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!

The scene was very different back then but the FOMO was real. This time around, there are several significant fundamental differences that could be a huge factor for where BTC goes next. From Bitcoin’s first touch of five figures to its all-time high was only 20 days. BTC doubled in price from November 28 to reach $20k on December 17, 2017. By December 22 a massive 40 percent correction had dumped it back down to $12k. BTC regained composure to climb back to $17.5k in early January but the writing was already on the wall. A fourteen-month bear market followed as BTC dumped 84% falling to $3,200 in mid-December 2018. Since that moment, it has regained over 200% to current levels which are now less than 50% off that ATH again. So what is different this time around? Before the big bull run at the end of 2017, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were not well known and largely considered playthings for geeks to mine in their garages. When digital asset markets surged over 700% in a year to $800 billion, they certainly attracted the attention of the mainstream as a FOMO frenzy ensued. The scene is way more mature this time around and there is a lot more information, research and even cautions to would be traders and speculators. People can make more informed decisions as the space has grown. Exchanges are offering far greater consumer protection, such as the Binance SAFU, a fund derived from trading commissions to cover losses in the event of a hack or security breach. There is no ICO boom this time, which is largely why Ethereum and the rest of the altcoins have remained frozen over. ETH is still down almost 80% from ATH. This has been good news for bitcoin which is largely seen as a store of wealth rather than a useable currency. Then there is the institutional angle. While CME and CBOE certainly raised the game with their futures offerings in December 2017, many speculated that the ability to short BTC ultimately led to its collapse the following year. This time around the list of firms preparing professional crypto products for institutional investors is immense. Huge names such as Fidelity, ICE’s Bakkt, ErisX, NASDAQ, Circle, and Grayscale have all entered the space and more are set to follow. Crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Robinhood, Huobi, OKEx, Bittrex and Bitfinex have all matured offering more services to compete for a larger market. Other technical factors such as next year’s block reward halving, and current hash rate highs, indicate that the ecosystem is extremely healthy and long term gains are virtually guaranteed. Bitcoin is here to stay and may even get a further boost from economic woes and political tensions which continue to escalate around the planet. How far will Bitcoin price climb this time?

A few hours ago BTC made it to $10k but it didn’t just stop and hold there. A surge of over 10% took Bitcoin to over $10,900 during the Asian trading session this morning. As reported by Bitcoinist yesterday, the likelihood of BTC reaching $10k within the next 24 hours was strong. A few hours ago Bitcoin lifted off from around $9,900 to surge 10%, or a thousand dollars, in just a couple of hours. According to Tradingview.com it topped out at $10,900, its highest price since March 2018. At the time of writing the hourly candle had yet to close and BTC was trading at 00. BTC price, hourly – Tradingview.com Daily volume has cranked up to $23 billion as Bitcoin market cap approached $200 billion. The epic move has reduced the gap to all-time high to 45.5%. Additionally BTC dominance is now over 59% as the altcoins get eaten alive. Now that both psychological and technical resistance at $10k has been smashed, traders and analysts are scouring the charts for the next resting point for BTC. This appears to be around $11,700 and there is not much but thin air from there all the way up to $16k. Josh Rager, who noted yesterday that there may be a fair bit of profit taking once BTC hit $10k, has changed his tune a little today adding: “If you like $BTC at $10k than you’re really going to love when BTC closes above $11,700… And resumes running through every resistance in its path to new all-time highs. Nothing sensational about this just look at the chart. Little will stand in the way besides profit taking,” Major mainstream media is going to be all over $10k Bitcoin which is likely to induce a wave of fomo similar to that seen in 2017.

Fielding questions during Thursday’s session of Fortune’s Brainstorm Finance 2019 conference, revealed that the Ripple CEO is a bitcoin bag holder. Commenting on the multifaceted nature of the emerging cryptocurrency landscape, Garlinghouse declared: I don’t think there is going to be one crypto rule them all, I own bitcoin, I’m long bitcoin [and] I think bitcoin is a store of value [so] people hold it. I don’t think there is going to be one use case [for cryptos]. ""I don't think that there will be one crypto to rule them all. I own bitcoin and am long bitcoin."" Quite a turnaround from @bgarlinghouse. Great stuff!! (#timestamp 5:03)https://t.co/JwngU5Y7I0 — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) June 21, 2019  Garlinghouse’s comments appear as something of a ‘180’ for the Ripple CEO who once claimed that China controlled bitcoin. At the time, the Ripple chief highlighted the overwhelming presence of Chinese miners in the bitcoin mining arena as part of the reasons for his assertions. Bitcoin is currently enjoying a stellar 2019, up by more than 150% since January 1, 2019. XRP, for its part, has only seen modest returns by cryptocurrency standards, gaining a little over 25% since the start of the year.  On the subject of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency announcement, Garlinghouse said the news was bullish for Ripple and XRP. According to the Ripple boss, Facebook’s entry into the payments really puts banks and other mainstream financial institutions to task about the state of their operating infrastructure. Speaking further on the matter, the Ripple chief quipped: This week will probably be the best week of signed contracts at Ripple, ever… I think the banks realize that if Facebook is going to be a competitor in this space, they can’t depend upon a technology like SWIFT to compete in the marketplace. Garlinghouse also reiterated Ripple’s commitment to stick to its target niche in the global financial ecosystem – transaction banking and liquidity management. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Ripple and money transfer giant MoneyGram have entered into a strategic partnership that will involve the use of the xRapid platform which could mean increased utility for the XRP cryptocurrency. Companies like Visa and the Fnality Consortium (backed by 15 major banks across the world) have also launched cross-border payment systems that could rival Ripple. For Garlinghouse, however, XRP remains an efficient bridge currency for interbank purposes. Will Ripple/XRP be able to stay ahead of the competition from mainstream actors like Visa and Facebook?

New 2019 price highs, renewed optimism, and other indicators show that investment in Bitcoin mining is about to be as profitable as it was prior to the 2018 bear market. In effect, in 2017, Bitmain declared profits of between USD 3 billion and USD 4 billion. Then, the Bitcoin winter came and Bitmain went through a challenging 2018 mired in administrative upheavals, employee terminations, and severe financial losses. Now, as the environment in the crypto industry turns brighter, the Chinese chip maker is reportedly reviving its plans for a multimillion-dollar expansion of its businesses into the United States. According to Bloomberg, The world’s biggest producer of cryptocurrency mining chips is reviving plans for an IPO https://t.co/E9g5LQQg3Z — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) June 21, 2019  [Bitmain] is working with advisers on preparations for a U.S. share sale that could take place as soon as the second half of this year, the people said. Bitmain aims to file listing documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as next month, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The news comes only 3 months after Bitmain’s original IPO filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange expired after failing to pass a 6-month ‘hearing stage’, as reported by Bitcoinist at the time. Bitmain’s hoping its business model will strike a better note with the Western market this time, and is allegedly seeking to raise between $300-500 Million – a far cry from the $3 Billion fundraising target it had for the HKEX IPO. Despite a devastating 2018, Bitmain has continued to be a leading force in the crypto hardware industry. In April 2019, Bitmain launched the next generation Antminer 17, the miner T17, with a hashrate of 40 TH/S. The Antminer 17 series comprises two other models: the Antminer S17 Pro and Antminer S17. Most recently, on June 18, 2019, the company announced its release of Antminer S9 SE, which allows mining of Bitcoin and 18 other digital coins, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, and Bitcoin Atom. The S9 SE price tag is $351, and it boasts the following specifications:  The company states, “To prevent hoarding and to ensure that more individual buyers can purchase miners in this batch, we have set a limit of 10 miners per user.” As Bitcoin’s price hits new 2019 highs and inches closer to the USD 10,000 target, investors will most likely start eying the Bitcoin mining sector with renewed interest. Regarding Bitmain’s U.S. IPO plans, Bloomberg reported, [Bitmain] could raise about $300 million to $500 million from the U.S. share sale, though it hasn’t finalized the amount it wants to seek, the people said.

Appearing on CNBC’s Fast Money on Monday (June 17, 2019), Worth revealed that he was bullish on bitcoin. Explaining his position, the market analyst highlighted the positive price trend both in the short-term and long-term for bitcoin. Bitcoin is booming to its highest price in a year and the Chart Master says it's heading straight for $10K $BTC pic.twitter.com/91R9GhfIgT — CNBC's Fast Money (@CNBCFastMoney) June 17, 2019  From a long-term perspective, bitcoin has broken above its long-standing downtrend. Since dropping to $3,100 back in December 2018, the top-ranked cryptocurrency has consistently set higher highs and more importantly, higher lows. Worth also joined the league of analysts identifying the $3,100 price level set in 2018 as bitcoin’s long-term bottom for this next bull phase. On a short-term basis, Worth drew attention to the sharp price spikes that follow each period of sideways consolidation. Since the ‘April Fool’s’ day surge, BTC has seen two of such bull flag patterns emerge indicating a sustained uptrend. Worth, however, didn’t provide any price forecast for bitcoin, instead, saying: The important thing is not about how high it can go, it’s that the lows of December are likely to stand as important lows and this is an enduring thing to be played on the long side. Back in 2007, Worth was one of the few analysts raising alarm over a possible bear market for U.S. stocks, at a time when market indices were at an all-time high (ATH). With BTC firmly in the mid-$9k region, the next key price level is obviously $10,000 which takes bitcoin more than 50% into its ATH. The path to $10k might not be so straightforward, though, given the rising wedge pattern seen in the BTC price action over the last month. A lot hinges on trading volume for BTC during this critical phase. Hopes of a fresh assault on $10k seemed overly optimistic less than three days ago as trading volume experienced significant contraction in the sub-$10k price range.  This trend however, seems to have experienced a reversal with 24-hour trading volumes now firmly north of $20 billion. A volume spike usually precedes a bullish breakout from a rising wedge pattern, as reported in an earlier Bitcoinist analysis. Thus, if trading activity continues to soar, then BTC could surge past $10,000. Analysts like Fundstrat’s Tom Lee say BTC at $10,000 will spark a new FOMO-driven hype that will see bitcoin top $40,000 before year’s end.

Discussing the habit of comparing Bitcoin to Tulip Mania, a favorite pastime for cryptocurrency critics, Blockchain Capital managing partner James Todaro said such labels will continue to be thrown around regardless of its growth. Writing on Twitter June 20, Todaro uploaded a fresh chart demonstrating Bitcoin’s considerably less ‘bubble-like’ performance compared to both the Tulip Mania and the South Sea Company in the early 1700s. He commented,  People always love to compare tulip mania with only the most recent bitcoin cycle and ignore the prior decade of growth   Bitcoin’s comedown from its December 2017 all-time highs around $20,000 provided fuel for a host of naysayers who claimed it would never recover from its fall. This month, as BTC/USD jumps 150% since April, Todaro predicts that once the current bull market runs out and a correction sets in, those same naysayers will ignore the entire history of Bitcoin once again – including the 2017 record. “I guarantee the next cycle will be the same (and) bitcoin critics will forget about the explosive growth in 2016/17,” he continued.  Commentators have held mixed opinions regarding Bitcoin’s short-term prospects. As Bitcoinist reported, popular sentiment currently revolves around potential buyers being gripped by ‘FOMO’ (‘fear of missing out’) when BTC/USD crosses the $10,000 mark.  The resulting influx and buying frenzy could push the pair as high as $40,000 by the end of 2019, Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Tom Lee told clients this week.  A similar theory about future trajectory came from Tyler Winklevoss, who revealed he also considered $10,000 a watershed moment.   Bulls remain quieter, however, about the prospect of a dramatic correction following on from future rapid gains in a style similar to early 2018.  Research points to the current bull market having less in common with 2017 and more with a previous uptick seen in 2012, while advocates also note the underlying technical strength of the Bitcoin network is much more solid this time around.  Looking further into the future, predictions remain more buoyant still, with the likes of investor Tim Draper predicting a $250,000 Bitcoin price by 2023. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and payment platform Square, this month doubled down on his prediction that Bitcoin should become a global internet currency within the next ten years.

Will BTC buyers be able to shake off this pattern and break through the psychological level? Let’s take a look.  On the daily BTC/USD chart we can see that 3 rising wedge patterns have appeared so far in bitcoin price 00 over the past 40 days. Typically, rising wedges are bearish reversal patterns, however bitcoin has already invalidated one on June 14 and went on to print a new YTD-high, as we’ll look at now. (1) The first rising wedge formed between May 1 – 30, as bitcoin bulls were desperately trying to break new ground above the $9,000 level. After briefly tipping over the psychological level on May 30 during the American trading session, a sharp sell off quickly took over the market and sent BTC plummeting nearly 12% before pulling back. On June 3, the rising wedge support eventually gave way under the mounting selling pressure and sent bitcoin cascading down into the next rising wedge pattern below. (2) The second rising wedge was a much smaller pattern which took shape between June 7 – 14.  Bitcoin trading volume ahead of this breakout was noticeable higher than the rising wedge before – as shown on the chart above – which suggested that bulls were attempting to reject the bearish reversal pattern. At around 21:00 (UTC+1) on June 14, a sudden spike in buying momentum catapulted bitcoin above $8,750, and out of harms way. (3) Looking at the price right now, we can see that by extending the resistance of the first pattern along with the support of the second pattern, a much larger rising wedge has now formed. This critical price point will be a highly tense moment for bitcoin traders, as both short and long traders have already piled in behind the psychological level. Because of this, whichever way BTC breaks it is undoubtedly going to trigger a squeeze in the futures market. This will either send the asset rocketing even higher if it breaks bullish, or push the price down even lower if breaks bearish. The only way we can know which way bitcoin is going ahead of the breakout, is by monitoring the volume. As we can see in the last two patterns, if volume starts to decline ahead of the maximum consolidation point then we should anticipate BTC to break downward, and vice versa.  On the weekly chart, we can see that the price is very close now to breaking through the resisting kumo (red cloud) on the Ichimoku indicator. This will be adding additional pressure on bullish traders to perform at the aforementioned breakout point, as a rally above $10,000 would drive BTC through the cloud and produce another huge bullish signal for bitcoin traders. The last time the price climbed through the resisting kumo was back in November, 2015, right before bitcoin went on to climb 4,400% to its ATH 3 years later. If BTC is able to do this again soon, it will undoubtedly attract more traders into the market just as Fundstrat’s Head Analyst, Tom Lee, predicted last week.

In May, around six weeks into Bitcoin’s bull market, mainstream media had already picked up on the idea of the cryptocurrency’s Treasury-like behavior.  “Don’t believe in central banks? No worries. Bitcoin is the US 10-year Treasury of the modern era,” the Financial Times wrote.  At the time, many believed the Treasury yield would continue, with Williamson among them.  He said in an April interview,  The advice I would have would be cash and treasuries[;] those were the top performing assets of 2018 and would most likely be some of the top performing assets in 2019 Using BTC as a safe haven against fiat – until recently something most economists would ridicule – has itself become a surprisingly accepted strategy in recent times.  As Bitcoinist reported, rising Bitcoin price on the back of solid network development has come amid a range of factors which threaten fiat positions.  Among them, geopolitical tensions, the US-China trade war and questions over dollar supremacy have fed demand among institutional investors for an alternative, specifically ‘digital gold.’ “It’s [Bitcoin] become a hedge against irresponsible monetary and fiscal policy,” Travis Kling, chief investment officer at Ikigai Asset Management, said in April.  “…We now have this set up where they [central banks] have become politicized both in the US and globally. It’s the new world we are living in.” More recently, even more unlikely praise came from traditionally Bitcoin-bearish JPMorgan Chase.  Commenting within the context of misreported trading volumes on most cryptocurrency exchanges, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, strategist at the bank, said it was necessary to note the comparatively trustworthy boom in Bitcoin futures trading.  This, he says, demonstrated institutional appetite was real, and its importance “has been significantly underestimated.” “The overstatement of trading volumes by cryptocurrency exchanges, and by implication the understatement of the importance of listed futures, suggests that market structure has likely changed considerably since the previous spike in Bitcoin prices in end-2017 with a greater influence from institutional investors,” he wrote in a report last week.

Now, the powerful traditional Bank of America has joined the unstoppable trend to build a cashless society. The advent of Bitcoin and its underlying technology, blockchain, has put in evidence that the combination of an antiquated institution such as banking and a three-thousand-year-old monetary system is incompatible with a borderless, digital, and fast-moving economic model. Today, developed countries and powerful bankers are recognizing that technological innovations such as blockchain and the Internet of Things, have doomed cash to disappear. And they are aware that these technologies offer new possibilities and innovative businesses solutions unimaginable until recently. Hence, the banking industry is now undergoing a reengineering revolution to get rid of cash-based transactions. For example, one of the most powerful bankers in the U.S., Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, acknowledged that his bank is joining the trend of non-cash transactions. As reported by Yahoo Finance, on June 19, 2019, Moynihan said at the Fortune Brainstorm Finance 2019 conference, We want a cashless society. * Bank of America CEO: 'We want a cashless society'  Yahoo Finance * Brainstorm Finance 2019: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan  Fortune Magazine * Bank of America CEO: ‘We Want a Cashless Society’  Fortune * View full coverage on Google News https://t.co/oPidG7MWHt — Fort Dodge Iowa (@FortDodgeIow) June 20, 2019  In this regard, according to Fortune, Moynihan pointed out that the banking industry ‘will continue to move’ towards digital, tech-enabled models—which, as he noted, are cheaper and more efficient than traditional methods. The movement towards a cashless society is underway and gaining momentum. Indeed, Moynihan concedes that more than half of all money transactions are already processed electronically; fuelled by the rise of cryptocurrencies, and payment platforms such as PayPal, Zelle digital payment network, and digital wallets. Not only is the bank industry bent on building a cashless society, but also many of the most developed countries in the world. Sweden, for instance, is the leader in the implementation of a cashless society, followed by Australia, South Korea, and China. Singapore is aiming to be the first cashless country in Asia. Singaporeans are already using several cashless payments methods, such as QR codes, PayNow, contactless mobile payments systems, and several mobile apps. Moreover, according to CardGuru, [Singapore] has one of the most bitcoin-friendly business environments in the world, welcoming the set up of bitcoin funds. But to set up the ultimate cashless society, the payment method should be frictionless, democratic, inflation-resistant, public, permissionless, and censorship-resistant. And, only Bitcoin possesses, among others, all of these attributes. How do you think banks embracing a cashless society will impact Bitcoin?

Opting for Unmanaged Exchange Rates', '2. Choosing a Capped Supply', '3. Doing the Hard Forks', '4. Upholding a Nondiscretionary Monetary Policy', '5. Going with Limited Block Space']","  Christina Comben | Jun 20, 2019 | 13:00 Libra may be the flavor of the month. Facebook’s “cryptocurrency” may be the catalyst for mass adoption if it gets the green light. But it won’t tip the scales on Bitcoin.  In a Medium article, Coinmetrics co-founder Nic Carter explains that Bitcoin’s design may seem clumsy to many at first, full of “flaws” that need to be fixed. He argues that many developers with flashy new altcoins look at Bitcoin with the attitude: I just heard about Bitcoin and I’m here to fix it However, there’s something rather important that the developers of Libra or any other altcoins are missing. Bitcoin wasn’t built that way by accident, but by making the hard choices. And in life, it’s the tough decisions that separate the weak from the strong. Here are five tough calls that Bitcoin purposefully made to guarantee it reigns supreme over Libra–or any other alt. One of Bitcoin’s biggest “disadvantages” as a currency as most people point out is its wild and unpredictable volatility. After all, central bankers are used to controlling their fiat currencies through exchange rates. This had lead to major players like IMF head Christine Lagarde to criticize it for its “risk” and “volatility.” Yet Carter reminds us: Bitcoin is almost perfectly inelastic in its supply, and so waves of adoption manifest themselves in gut-wrenching price gyrations. This contrasts with sovereign currencies where the central bank pulls various levers to ensure relative exchange rate stability. While Bitcoin cannot control its stability or manage exchange rates, it can make capital entirely portable and remove capital controls from the equation. It also takes out any type of central authority from the picture to control these capital flows or rates. This is the arch opposite of Libra that will be pegged to a basket of fiat currencies. Libra will never be a permissionless currency since there will always be the need for a central party to control the currencies backing the coin: The bullet bitcoin bites is an unstable exchange rate, but in return, it frees itself from any third party and wins an independent monetary policy. A decent trade. The fact that Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million has long been a contentious point of debate. After all, it’s almost unthinkable to any sovereign currency and central banker who can print money out of thin air at will. Moreover, when it comes to the majority of altcoins, they also opt for a perpetual issuance system. This is usually to go toward funding the project, team, marketing, sustainability, further development and so on. Bitcoin, by not being able to ever mine more than the capped supply, means that it will have to get creative down the road for keeping the network secure, most likely through its transaction fees. Carter states: Bitcoin, in typical bullet-biting fashion, selects the less palatable of the two choices — capped supply and a fee market — in order to obtain a trait its users find desirable: genuine, unimpeachable scarcity. Hard forks can be messy and poorly orchestrated ones can even lead to chaos: namely the introduction of bugs, increased attack vectors, and vulnerabilities on the network. Regularly hard forking of the blockchain can also force some participants out should they need to run backwards compatible software or hardware. But, forks force quick decision making in a decentralized community. They can also lead to power struggles and developer ill intent. Forks aren’t clean and they aren’t pretty. But at the end of the day, Bitcoin made this hard choice anyway with no single entity or authority in charge of how the blockchain develops.  Once again, Bitcoin takes the difficult road by making it impossible to follow a discretionary monetary policy. It can’t just be created at will like fiat money to finance wasteful projects from wars in foreign countries to building walls on borders. Other altcoins present discretionary inflation as a good thing, for ongoing finance, and other such reasons. However, Carter notes: Quite simply, enabling discretion in monetary policy creates a profound abundance that the project administrators can exploit. This, however, comes with drawbacks: it opens the door to rent-seeking, exploitation, and wealth redistribution, all of which harm the long-term integrity of the project. Bitcoin with its capped supply is able to provide lasting and genuine scarcity. It removes the ability for humans to make discretionary calls to adjust the supply. This is unpopular with many but: Bitcoin bites the bullet by doing away with inflation-based financing, choosing to live or die on its own merits. Many other altcoins wonder why Bitcoin took the decision to follow the almost “unpalatable choice” of limiting its block size at around 1mb, with an upper limit of 4mb.  However, capping block space may seem inconvenient but it allows Bitcoin the option to transfer from sustaining the network through block rewards to transaction fees. Moreover, as has been the case with EOS, making blocks larger and creating more block space introduces a lot of spam usage to the blocks. This is partly because the incentives to create the illusion of activity on chain were high, and the cost to do so was minimal. Bitcoin’s decision to limit the block size comes down to sustainability; another reason it will outlast Libra or any other alt. After all, if the block space were unbounded it would be essentially worthless, as Carter notes: How much would you pay for a commodity that is infinite in supply?  How do you think Libra will stack up next to Bitcoin?

']","  Ollie Leech | Jun 20, 2019 | 11:40 Bitcoinist Senior Analyst, FilbFilb, has identified a bullish MACD convergence on the 1-month BTC/USD chart, which only ever happens just before Bitcoin price goes parabolic.  Bitcoin is about to have its third monthly bullish MACD cross of all time. Its worked out pretty well in the past. 😈 pic.twitter.com/5UtrPJPsGL — fil₿fil₿ (@filbfilb) June 20, 2019  For months now the crypto community has been in limbo over whether or not to believe that Bitcoin has entered into a new bull market. In spite of the halving event due next year, Bitcoin’s recent break above $9K and the network hashrate shattering ATH’s, there are still those who are waiting to see BTC break the $10K mark or beyond before accepting that ‘Crypto Spring’ is upon us. https://twitter.com/teddycleps/status/1132908794067992576  But now, thanks to FilbFilb’s findings, we can say with a high degree of certainty that the Bitcoin bull market has officially arrived – even if Bitcoin is still under $10K right now.   To put the MACD convergence into perspective, this is only the third time that the 12MA has ever crossed above the 26MA on the BTC/USD monthly chart. For those of you who aren’t technical analysts, it’s also worth noting that, with chart indicators, there’s a general rule that higher time frames show stronger signals. So a signal on the monthly is very strong!   The last time that we saw a convergence on the monthly MACD like this, Bitcoin price 00 rose 5,400% over the following 600 days – from $355 to its ATH at $20,000. If we take that percentage growth figure and apply it to Bitcoin’s current price at $9,350 (at the time of writing), it gives us an approximate peak of $52,000 around February 2021. This figure isn’t actually a million miles away from Fundstrat’s Tom Lee’s latest prediction that he made earlier in the week, where he proposed that Bitcoin will hit $40K over the next few months. Many other proponents, including one half of the Winklevoss twins today, are also anticipating a serious surge of FOMO buying to kick off soon once the $10,000 is successfully tested.

In a tweet by “Cane Island Crypto” on Wednesday (June 19, 2019) the bitcoin analyst revealed a trend which shows a cooling period for bull rallies between August and September. This conclusion comes from examining the median BTC monthly returns since 2010. https://twitter.com/nsquaredcrypto/status/1141376159575347201/photo/1 According to the data, August has been bitcoin’s worst-performing month between 2010 and 2018. With the month less than eight weeks away, the trend might repeat itself causing a temporary lull in BTC’s bullish advance. Before then, BTC might push on to reach even newer highs in 2019. Based on the evidence, April, June, and July have seen positive aggregated price movements since 2010. Thus, if the trend holds through, then bitcoin could possibly be in for a continuation of its hot 2019 streak. July, however, holds the lowest positive aggregated median bitcoin return under the period being considered.  Bitcoin has always seemed to suffer seasonal summer declines usually lasting from June 6 to October 8 on the average. According to Seasonax – a trading analysis platform – BTC’s annualized summer declines over the last seven years stands at more than 13%. This historical trend may play well into expectations of a slight BTC price retrace espoused in recent weeks by the likes of Trace Mayer and Tuur Demeester. Both commentators see BTC experiencing a price dip to somewhere in mid-$6k to mid-$7k region. While history predicts summer doldrums for BTC, technical indicators seem to paint a different picture. In a tweet published by Filbfilb, senior analyst at Bitcoinist, bitcoin is about to see its third monthly bullish MACD crossover of all time. Bitcoin is about to have its third monthly bullish MACD cross of all time. Its worked out pretty well in the past. 😈 pic.twitter.com/5UtrPJPsGL — fil₿fil₿ (@filbfilb) June 20, 2019  The last bullish MACD cross happened at the back-end of 2016 which culminated in the late 2017 bull run that saw BTC almost top $20,000. So even if a slight lull occurs between August and September, BTC, overall, seems poised to enter a long-term phase of parabolic advance. The imminent bullish MACD cross is the latest indicator to point towards a long-term bull trend for the top-ranked cryptocurrency. Such is the optimism that BTC bulls are making bold end-of-year price predictions. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Tom Lee of Fundstrat expects bitcoin to reach $40,000 within the coming months. Lee’s forecast, however, hinges of the move above $10,000 triggering a return FOMO among retail investors. Will the bitcoin summer weakness trend continue in 2019?

Writing on social media as Bitcoin price circled $9250, one half of the Winklevoss twins forecast that the cryptocurrency’s trajectory would see it home in on its 2017 all-time high of $20,000. “If bitcoin breaks 10k, you can bet it’s going to break 15k,” he tweeted June 19.  BTC/USD has broadly recovered from a correction earlier this month which saw the pair touch a low of $7570 on June 10. The latest in a series of surges, Bitcoin price subsequently set its highest level in over a year of $9430 just days later.  Shaking off concerns such as controversial incoming regulation, Bitcoin markets continue their bull run which began April 1, taking gains for investors to more than 130 percent over the past three months alone.  For Winklevoss, as the co-founder of exchange platform Gemini, BTC is still undervalued in the long term.  Asked why he was so bullish about the market in its current state by ‘Broken Markets’ author Joe Saluzzi, he said that while it remained a comparative niche, Bitcoin is a buy. “It’s a cheap asset until it disrupts gold, however, the 2nd time breaking 10k will make it feel more ‘real’ to many people,” he responded. While BTC/USD has so far failed to retake the $10,000 mark, which it last did in March 2018, this year’s bull run has restored faith among investors and presented a headache for naysayers who had already announced the cryptocurrency’s ‘death.’ As Bitcoinist reported, the coming weeks will see a ‘Cryptocurrency Duel’ between serial Bitcoin hater Nouriel Roubini and BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, while fellow arch-bear Warren Buffett will face a host of crypto industry figures at a dedicated charity lunch event.  Meanwhile, other advocates have delivered even more enthusiastic Bitcoin price forecasts than Winklevoss. This week, Fundstrat Global Advisors senior analyst Tom Lee doubled down on his previous price talk, claiming BTC/USD would reach $40,000 before 2020.  Similarly, such a huge move would come as a result of investor ‘FOMO’ – ‘fear of missing out’ – once Bitcoin hit $10,000 again, he had said.  Lee is a case in point for Bitcoin sentiment over the past six months. At the end of 2018, when price hovered around $3000, he had said he would retire from predicting its path for clients, only to resurface during the bull market several months later.

These include founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, embezzling customer funds to margin trade (badly) on other exchanges for years.  The cryptocurrency landscape is no stranger to misdeeds, transgressions, and scandal. But even amongst this backdrop, the QuadrigaCX story stands out as something exceptional. What looked to be building towards a standard exit scam, got flipped upside down in mid-January this year. QuadrigaCX announced the ‘sudden passing’ of founder, CEO, and ‘visionary leader’, Gerald Cotten in India… over a month previously.  Oh, and by the way, he was the only one with access to the private keys of the cold wallets. Even as the company received a temporary reprieve from creditors, many were questioning the legitimacy of the story. Court-appointed monitor, Ernst and Young, published its fifth report yesterday, revealing some disturbing truths about the running of the business. In terms of company infrastructure, there was virtually none, with activity largely directed solely by Cotten. Separation of duties and basic internal controls was non-existent, as was segregation of QuadrigaCX funds and Client funds. There were no accounting records, and Cotten himself decreed that administrator activities would not be logged. This allowed Cotten to create fake accounts, and credit them with hundreds of millions of dollars of fiat and crypto. He then traded this with real crypto from other users and transferred it off the QuadrigaCX exchange. The majority of this went to accounts in Cotten’s name on other exchanges. Between 2016 and 2019, Cotten transferred almost 10,000 BTC, 390,000 ETH, and 240,000 LTC out of QuadrigaCX. So what did he do with this money? Much was margin traded, with all the due care and attention that one might expect from someone gambling with other people’s money. He ran up substantial losses and his margin was liquidated. Another (unnamed) exchange received 21,501 BTC in an account under Cotten’s name. All but 8 BTC of this was liquidated for the equivalent of around $80 million over three years. The whereabouts of this $80 million is unknown. Cotten and his ‘widow’, Jennifer Robertson, also received significant fiat transfers from Quadriga over the years. Obviously, also unaccounted for. Their assets, including real estate, private aircraft and yachts, luxury cars and precious metals, are subject to a preservation order. The monitor intends to recover and liquidate these assets for the benefit of creditors. This however, when added to the assets already recovered, still leaves a shortfall of around CAD$170 million. The final act of this saga (which would come as no surprise to anyone at this stage), must surely be Cotten turning up alive and well (or just as possibly dead) on a tropical beach somewhere. Okay, so maybe our collective imagination is getting away from us, but it seems like a better bet than leaving your money on an exchange like QuadrigaCX. The tl;dr of the latest report from the QuadrigaCX CCAA monitor is that Quadriga’s deceased founder Gerald Cotten was running a fraudulent crypto exchange for years.

Most industry heavyweights are in agreement that Libra is about as far from bitcoin as the greenback is, but the new digital offering will have an impact on the crypto scene, and it may not be that bad. Everyone from grandmothers to William Shatner has commented on Libra since Zuckerberg et al released the details earlier this week. Crypto markets did not even blip but there could be wider implications as the world’s largest social media network attempts to take on the planet’s biggest banks. Facebook has in excess of 2 billion users so it stands to reason that a digital payments system on the platform will increase awareness of crypto currencies for millions that previously considered them deep in the realms of geekdom.  Once people realize that they can send payments instantly and for virtually no cost, bypassing banks and expensive foreign exchange intermediaries, the light may suddenly go on. Bitcoin and other crypto assets can do exactly that, but without the big blue overseer prying on who, why and where the funds are going. RT’s Max Keiser is of similar opinion. Like many, he believes that Bitcoin will ultimately benefit from Facebook’s foray into crypto assets; It’s built into the protocol’s genesis block that eventually a heavyweight like $fb would take on BTC. This increased awareness and appeal to would-be potentates will, of course, drive the hashrate to new highs, leading to new ATH for BTC price. Zuck is Satoshi’s useful idiot.

Here’s a news flash for you. At $8,940, it’s bigger than Russia’s monetary base. That makes Bitcoin the eighth largest currency in the world. And the price keeps on climbing… The answer might surprise you. Check out the chart below by Crypto Voices. You’ll see that gold is still by far the largest monetary system in the world at almost $8 trillion. However, Bitcoin is hot on its heels.  When it comes to a country’s monetary base, however, that is measured in terms of the total amount of currency in circulation or held in commercial deposits in the central bank, not in its gold reserves.  With its $25 trillion dollar debt, it’s no surprise that despite being the world’s largest economy, the U.S. lags in fourth place behind Japan, China, and the Euro Zone when it comes to base money. You might wonder why oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates don’t appear on this report. Is it because most of their wealth is held in oil and not in fiat?  Crypto Voices says: Don’t know their methodologies, but Saudi Arabia and Denmark, for example, are pegged currencies, so their base money is the USD and EUR, respectively, and shouldn’t be counted. The correct economic comparison is the monetary base value of each currency’s central bank. If you don’t count gold and silver, Bitcoin is now the eight largest currency in the world. It comes in at 9th place after the two precious metals. How significant is this? Well, with a market cap currently at $162 billion and with some analysts predicting a BTC value of over $40k by the end of 2019, after just 10 years of being created, it’s a pretty big deal indeed. Bitcoin is already bigger than the base money of Russia, South Korea, Brazil, Canada, and Norway. With cryptocurrency adoption on the rise around the world, it won’t be long before it catches up with–and overtakes–the monetary base of India, Switzerland, the UK, and, yes, the United States as well.

In its report, the Japanese Consumer Affairs Agency (CAA) revealed that cryptocurrency-related queries totaled 3,657 cases. This figure constitutes a 69% spike from 2017’s figures which amounted to 2,166 cases. Despite the increase in the overall number, the year-on-year growth in the total number of complaints did decrease to 1.7x in 2018. Previous years had recorded a more than 3.5x growth in the number of queries received by the CAA. This increase in the number of complaints is another indication of the popularity of the industry despite the bear market conditions of 2018. Last year, cryptocurrency prices tanked after reaching record highs in late 2017. The massive plummet in prices across the board quite also possibly contributed to more complaints being registered. Back in mid-2018, ValuePenguin – a consumer research firm issued a report showing that the early 2018 decline in cryptocurrency prices triggered an increase in consumer complaints across the United States.  According to the CAA report, the complaints received contained questions concerning several facets of the cryptocurrency market. Some of the core areas distilled from the over 3,600 cases include inquiries about privacy, refunds in the event of theft or platform issues, and poor user interface on some exchanges, to mention a few. One of the more troubling complaints revealed by the CAA was some traders claiming certain exchanges engaged in fraudulent behavior – false advertising, withholding customer deposits, and not delivering purchased cryptocurrencies. The country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) will most likely be coordinating with the CAA to investigate these matters. The financial regulator has since 2017 increased its oversight of the cryptocurrency trading arena. Recently, the FSA has announced its intention to introduce even tighter regulatory control on cryptocurrency exchanges. This move comes as the country pushes for a favorable rating by the Financial Action Taskforce (FATF) when the intergovernmental body comes visiting later in the year. According to the report, most of the queries revolved around altcoin trading. The CAA says the number of bitcoin-related questions declined from 2017 to 2018. Back in April 2019, Australia’s consumer protection watchdog also reported a 200% spike in crypto-related fraud in 2018. What do you think about this latest report? Let us know in the comments below!

According to a recent tweet from one of the world’s largest Bitcoin derivatives marketplace, the number of open BTC1! contracts reached a record $250 Million in notional spot value on June 17. This equates to around 26,555 BTC, which shows a huge 80% increase compared to last June’s figures. CME Bitcoin futures (BTC) shows growing signs of institutional interest. BTC open interest rose by a record 643 contracts in a single day, establishing a new all-time high of 5,311 contracts on June 17 (26,555 equivalent bitcoin; ~$250M notional). https://t.co/I6A3jD6Iq3 pic.twitter.com/ljz6EbvK79 — CMEGroup (@CMEGroup) June 18, 2019  It is believed that this meteoric rise in BTC open interest is the direct result of increased institutional investment coming into the market over the last quarter. This is highly possible given the huge developments that have happened in the crypto space over the last few months: namely Bitcoin’s climb to $9K, Facebook stepping into the blockchain space and Fidelity launching its crypto custodian service.  This is important because for many years the crypto market had been largely driven by retail investors in an unregulated environment, which lacked the legitimacy and liquidity to tempt in bigger players from the traditional financial space. Over time however, Bitcoin’s recognition as a decentralized store-of-value has grown to the extent that we are now starting to see a wave of capital enter the market from funds, family offices, HNWI’s and financial institutions. Along with this money, institutions are ushering in much-needed consumer protections, new financial products to bridge the gap with traditional finance, and helping to drive the overall mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve seen how Bitcoin’s impressive bullish streak to new YTD-highs has subsequently created a number of large short squeezes across Bitfinex, Bitmex and other futures platforms. These squeezes have had a dramatic effect on Bitcoin’s price and are directly responsible for helping the asset print its recent highs. Long squeezes also have a damaging effect on the price, by forcing bullish traders to liquidate their positions after a sharp price decline and send Bitcoin tanking further. As reported by Bitcoinist in an earlier article, CME gaps have also been playing an important role in creating significant price movements during the recent bull market – including the heavy $600 crash on May 16 and the $350 pump on June 10. These gaps will only become more exacerbated as new institutional players step into the market. So while the arrival of institutional investment is regarded as a huge advantage for the crypto market, it is also more than likely to cause an increase in CME gaps and forced liquidations that have an overriding effect on BTC price volatility.

Confirming his participation in a debate with the fiat veteran, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes laid down the gauntlet ahead of time, promising to stand up for Bitcoin in the face of one of its most outspoken critics. The debate, which is described by organizers as the “biggest in cryptocurrency history,” will take place 2019 Asia Blockchain Summit in Taipei on July 3.  Dubbed the ‘Cryptocurrency Duel,’ the event echoes a previous encounter between Roubini and trading guru Tone Vays, which was marked by the former shouting down his opponent when he attempted to build arguments around cryptocurrency. “I’m going to wipe the floor with that chump,” Hayes promised on Twitter.  As Bitcoinist often reports, Roubini has made a name for himself as the ultimate naysayer when it comes to Bitcoin. Known as ‘Dr. Doom’ for his negativity, the economist continues to express all-out doubt about any cryptocurrency having a tangible future in the global economy. His most recent outburst focused on stablecoins, which he described as “an oxymoron as most of them are unstable and not fully backed.”  “They are like fixed rate regimes or currency boards that eventually collapse,” he tweeted Wednesday.  Previously, in November 2018 as Bitcoin price suffered a sharp drop after the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, Roubini claimed the event was a sign BTC/USD was trending to zero.  He has since witnessed markets rebound to their highest in over a year, but shows no sign of U-turning on his position.  The debate with Hayes will come several weeks before the cryptocurrency industry takes on another of its arch critics in the form of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett.  Having called Bitcoin “rat poison squared” among other things, Buffett will spend his annual charity auction lunch event in the company of some of the best-known crypto figures.  Justin Sun, CEO of blockchain platform Tron, won the auction and paid over $4.5 million to dine with Buffett. Charlie Lee, creator of Litecoin, will also attend, along with various others.  “It might be unrealistic in just three hours to convince Warren Buffett to buy cryptocurrencies… We just want to show him the recent progress of… cryptocurrency and… blockchain technology,” Sun told the media about the plan. Who will win the Hayes/Roubini Bitcoin debate? Let us know in the comments below!","['Arthur Hayes', 'bitcoin', 'Nouriel Roubini']"

However, this is difficult to achieve on-chain, particularly when a block is mined roughly every 10 minutes Now, a web-based tool is promising to make Bitcoin a reliable, seamless and affordable payment option. On June 13, 2019, software developer and co-founder at Grant.io, Willie O’Beirne gave an introduction of Joule Allowances. Automatic #LightningNetwork micropayments are coming to @LightningJoule soon, here's a little preview. Still in the polish stage, so feedback is welcome!https://t.co/pRY4Thaiou — Will O'Beirne (@wbobeirne) June 13, 2019  Joule is a WebLN-enabled browser extension that utilizes the user’s own lightning node to enable seamless micropayments in the background. To avoid confusing Joule’s users and to make its operation more practical, O’Beirne notes that for now Joule Allowance payments will be restricted to payments made via WebLN only. WebLN is a library that comprises of specifications for lightning apps and client providers to facilitate secure communications between apps and users’ lightning nodes. To transact payments with Joule, the user needs an app that accepts or makes Lightning payments, as well as a compatible web browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. Soon, Brave will also become compatible. When configuring the allowance, the user will have the options of setting the maximum amount of satoshis that the application use, the maximum amount per payment, and the frequency with which the payments can be made.  Joule Allowances is still under development. O’Beirne explains, Joule’s interface is just the start of automatic payments while browsing the web with Lightning. There’s currently ongoing discussion of how to programmatically request, configure, and inspect allowances via WebLN, a discussion of using the HTTP 402 response code for payments (that could be done automatically), and new features that would make programmable auto-payments more feasible (e.g., customizable LND macaroons.) Regardless of whether a fee is high or low, transactions have to wait to be confirmed with the next block, which usually takes around 5-15 minutes. According to Bitcoinfees.earn.com, as of this writing, the fastest and cheapest transaction fee is 72 satoshis/byte. And for the median transaction size of 225 bytes, the charge is 16,200 satoshis. (One bitcoin equals 100 million satoshis.) However, technical innovations such as Lighting Network and SegWit are easing network congestion, particularly in terms of scalability and reduced transaction fees. Now, the advent of automated payments such as Joule Allowances gets Bitcoin one step closer to become a viable micropayment option as well. What impact do you think Joule Allowances will have on Bitcoin micropayments? Let us know in the comments below!

According to Bloomberg, Tom Lee expects bitcoin to go as high as $40,000 within the remainder of 2019. The Fundstrat co-founder and chief analyst conveyed his forecast in a note to clients issued on Monday (June 17, 2019). For Lee, FOMO-driven hype will fuel BTC’s 400% price climb causing the top-ranked cryptocurrency to set a new all-time high (ATH). The Fundstrat analyst also identified the $10,000 price level as a massively important psychological milestone that will trigger this new wave of ‘cryptomania.’ Lee is no stranger to optimistic price targets having predicted an end-of-year price of $25,000 for BTC in 2018. However, last year turned out to be a prolonged bear market for cryptocurrencies in general as prices sank by more than 80% across the board. Bitcoin is currently enjoying a stellar performance in 2019, especially since April. BTC is up almost 150% since the start of the year, adding more than $5,000 to its price since the ‘April Fool’s day’ surge.  Lee isn’t the only one waxing optimistic about BTC. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital expects bitcoin to have a mammoth 12-18 months given the current state of the global economy and the policies being enacted by central bankers across the world. Analysts at CNBC are even talking up bitcoin once again. Although, like many in the crypto industry know, CNBC tends to be something of a “reverse indicator” for BTC.

Even analysts at CNBC point to the $3,100 of mid-December 2018 as bitcoin’s long-term bottom. Not only is the price on the upward trajectory, but network fundamentals are also reaching new heights. Last Friday, the hash rate reached a new all-time high indicating a healthy mining scene. Back in late 2018, there had been fears of a mining death spiral as the BTC price slipped even lower. There were reports of miners capitulating and downing tools. However, the recent growth in hash rate and mining difficult means the network is now more secure than ever.

Are we going to be in for a turbulent week? Let’s take a look.  Between the 15-16 June, bullish traders catapulted Bitcoin price 00 over the critical $9K level after rejecting a bearish rising wedge pattern the day before. Because of this new impulse movement during the traditional financial market close, it caused a $570 gap to appear on the CME bitcoin futures chart between $8,485 and $9,055.   As mentioned in a previous analysis, these CME gaps have a tendency to act like magnets on the price action and often invite traders to close them by moving in the opposite direction. A gap like this, as shown above, was caused by a freak surge in bullish momentum over the weekend, and so now bearish traders are being tempted to sell or short the market in order to close it.   The distance between last week’s close and the new week open represents a considerable 6.39% difference in price. If Bitcoin’s price continues to correct from its recent YTD-high, it runs the risk of retracing back the $9K level and triggering bears to fill the gap.   Looking at the current market momentum, we can see that BTC price appears to be losing altitude as buying volume on the histogram decreases and the RSI returns back into the index channel.   If the 12MA bearishly diverges with the 26MA as well, we will have another firm bearish signal that BTC is likely to continue declining.    Looking at the Bitfinex BTC derivative market, we can see that there’s been a substantial 40% hike in short positions over the last 7 days despite Bitcoin’s price reaching a new YTD-high. This is the biggest rise in shorts since Bitcoin hit the $5K level.   These extra 7,359 shorts tell us two things. Either way, we could be in for a very volatile week if any of these two scenarios play out.  Which way do you think Bitcoin is heading this week?

But Wasnt Something Else BTC2 Too?']","  Emilio Janus | Jun 18, 2019 | 09:00 For Bitcoin maximalists who only want to pay Bitcoin Cash fees, SideShift AI has just launched a solution. Best to start at the beginning, yes. SideShift AI is an automated coin swap, essentially allowing users to swap coins between chains. The application allows exchanges between over twenty different cryptocurrencies, including BTC, BCH, BNB, ETH, DASH, LTC, USDT, and more. Simply select your chosen currencies for conversion, input the destination wallet address, and send your source tokens to the address/qr provided. It’s a bit like ShapeShift was, before it got all ‘mandatory KYC‘ on us, and handing customer data over to law enforcement. SideShift is still currently at ‘Early Adopter’ stage, and requires an access code, which potential ‘early adopters’ can apply for. I’m so glad you asked. SideShift AI came up with BTC2, bedecking it with the slogan, ‘Core Cash: Where Store-of-Value meets Medium-of-Exchange’. Snappy, I think you’ll agree. BTC2 is a token on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain (using SLP technology) which is fully pegged to and backed by on-chain BTC. SideShift AI early adopters can convert BTC2 to BTC at 1:1 for free and vice versa. Transactions are therefore processed on the BCH blockchain, with BCH blockchain fees. It has similarities to Tether, in that USDT is like an IOU for USD, where Tether hold the dollars (or at least 74% of them). Essentially, BTC2 is the IOU and SideShift AI acts as custodian of the on-chain BTC. You’ll be thinking of Bitcoin2. This Bitcoin fork hit the news a couple of weeks ago after pumping 5500% in a day. It looked like a classic ‘pump and dump’ scheme, which made it all the more unusual when its official Twitter account responded to the SideShift AI announcement. “Could you not manage to do a simple google search for BTC2 before naming your silly token?” it asked. Could you not manage to do a simple google search for BTC2 before naming your silly token? — Bitcoin 2 (@Bitc2org) June 14, 2019  This (and that awful animated GIF) aside, there were some who applauded SideShift AI’s BTC2, notably BitRefill COO, John Carvalho, who tweeted: I feel a new respect for [SideShift AI founder Andreas Brekken] for being adept at transcending both shitcoinery and bitcoin maximalism at the same time. “This, too,” he asserted, “is good for Bitcoin.” What do you make of Sideshift AI’s new BTC2 coin?

How will it be different this time around? Cast your mind back to November 2017, the first time BTC was trading at this price 00. What’s changed since then and why is it so much better placed this time around?  When Bitcoin soared over $9K the last time, the entire panorama looked completely different. There may have been a handful of companies accepting Bitcoin payments but many of the U-turned on their policies when its volatility became too complicated.  Flash forward to 2019, and the number of big-name businesses scrambling to get in long–and getting longer all the time. Microsoft is building on the Bitcoin blockchain and adding the BTC symbol to its flagship Excel product. Apple added the BTC symbol to its character set. Facebook rather than trying to ignore it is now busy trying to jump on the ‘cryptocurrency’ hype with it, and companies like Whole Foods are accepting payments. 2019 is a completely different ecosystem surrounding Bitcoin with greater awareness, deeper understanding, and a solid institutional investment. CBOE and CME may have been about to launch their Bitcoin futures products (which may have contributed to its price fall last time around) but beyond a few hedge funds and dedicated blockchain investment firms, there were no major names on board.  Institutions were watching on agape as retail FOMO saw the price surge… but they weren’t getting in.  This time around, major investment firms like Fidelity are storing it, ICE markets backed Bakkt is soon to be launching physically settled futures contracts with it, and TD Ameritrade is now trading it. The banks were staunchly opposed, advising their customers not to invest in it. Most notably, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin “stupid.” Now in 2019, one of the world’s largest banks has its own “cryptocurrency” the JPM Coin. Since 2017, the Bitcoin blockchain has been building and improving. Now, transaction speed, usage, hash rate, and block size are all up, while transaction fees are down massively by 68%.  Yes, payments and volume are also down, but these are signs that people realize the value Bitcoin has. Fewer people are paying for things in Bitcoin and using it as a store of value. The SEC had yet to declare that Bitcoin was not a security, and regulators were watching on with caution. But now that there is a greater understanding of the use cases and worth of Bitcoin, it’s actively being debated at the highest level.  A group of Congressmen is fighting to push through a Token Taxonomy Act to exempt many coins from being securities with U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang pledging to help push it through if voted in. In 2017, most people hadn’t even heard of Bitcoin. This time around, it’s a word used fairly often in people’s vocabulary even reaching the political dialogue at the highest levels of government. A lot has changed since the last time Bitcoin reached this peak–almost everything, in fact. And there’s an awful lot to encourage us that this is just the start.

Bitcoin demand in Hong Kong is starting to surge as an increasing amount of citizens are seeking refuge in the decentralized currency.  The extradition bill, which will bring in new laws to deport all non-mainland criminal suspects back to China for court proceedings, has caused a great deal of economic uncertainty.  It is this uncertainty, which has understandably driven more people towards the world’s best-performing asset class right now. Not only does Bitcoin offer unrivaled privacy when compared with other assets, but it is also free from the control of a centralized governing authority.  This political neutrality, in particular, is what makes Bitcoin such a popular hedge during times of economic uncertainty and is why we often see a rise in price around these events. As reported by Bitcoinist, there have been reports that rioters in Hong Kong are no longer using prepaid cards or other traceable payment options when traveling in a bid to remain anonymous from authorities.  High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI) have also allegedly begun redistributing capital overseas to secure their wealth.  In a recent tweet posted by senior eToro senior market analyst, Mati Greenspan, it was highlighted that Bitcoin’s price was trading at a $160 premium on Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, Tidebit, compared to the rest of the market.  He explained that this was a result of protesters flocking to Bitcoin as a ‘safe haven.’ Bitcoin is trading at a premium of about $160 in Hong Kong. Pictured is the HK exchange TideBit where a single BTC is going for 73,120 HKD ($9337). A total of $159 above Coindesk's current rate. This is where the safe haven play comes in. pic.twitter.com/HNZWQkJ61j — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) June 17, 2019  This premium has since climbed a further $15 compared to the spot price on Marketwatch’s index, over the last 5 hours. Right now, BTC is up at 74,100 HKD (1.34%) which stands at approximately $9,462. We could expect to see this number to rise further if the Hong Kong government continues to uphold the new bill.       This would be a great opportunity for arbitrage traders if Tidebit’s trading volume wasn’t so thin right now.  Despite the climbing price, only 21.459 bitcoins have passed through the order book so far, which is tiny when you compare it to Binance’s 24-hr trading volume of 45,221 BTC. This could be a direct result of people not being in their homes transacting over exchanges whilst the protesting is going on.  Or perhaps Hong Kong investors are resorting to purchasing bitcoins by other means such as with cash to protect their privacy.   What are your thoughts on Bitcoin’s price right now?

The crypto exchange giant announced the news via a blog post on its website published on Monday (June 17, 2019). According to the statement, Binance plans to offer crypto-pegged tokens on its DEX platform beginning with BTCB. Users will be able to trade the BTCB/trading pair. According to Binance, the trading pairs of these BEP2 tokens will always that of a pegged token and its native cryptocurrency. Binance says each crypto-pegged BEP2 token will be fully backed by the native cryptocurrency. The company says it will also provide the address to the reserve wallet so that interested persons can perform their own personal audit. Changpeng Zhao, the Binance chief even posted a lighthearted Tweet a few hours before the announcement saying there would be a 9001 BTC transaction originating from the platform’s wallet. There will be a transfer of 9001 BTC soon, no need to FUD. It's for a good thing, details to follow. Waiting for whale_alert. — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) June 17, 2019  Anyone looking to keep tabs on the reserve BTC funds for the BTCB token can do so via the address provided by Binance. While the transparency is laudable, it also seems like a cheeky dig at fiat-pegged stablecoins especially with an excerpt from the statement which reads thus: The blockchain offers a much easier way to audit a crypto reserve than a traditional bank balance tether.  For Binance, launching crypto-pegged trading pairs provides more markets for traders on its platform. This expanded trading catalog, the company believes, will increase liquidity on its DEX platform. On the whole, Binance expects users to avail themselves of the opportunity to trade tokens not found on other platforms. By so doing, Binance hopes the overall utility of its DEX platform will continue to increase thus maintaining its status as the top-ranked decentralized cryptocurrency marketplace in the industry. Details published in the announcement show that the trading in the BTCB/BTC pair will have a price spread of 0.1% with primarily large buy orders. To maintain 100% backing for the new trading pairs, the exchange says it will make sure that: The sum of the buy order and the funds on the published reserve address will be bigger than the total supply of the pegged token, ensuring there is always 100% backing. Aside from the promise of increased liquidity on the Binance DEX, the launch of crypto-pegged BEP2 tokens also constitutes an extension of the swap used to exchange ERC20 BNB tokens into actual BEP2 BNB tokens.

The Litecoin creator tweeted that he was ‘excited about this opportunity to meet a legend’. We believe this refers to Buffett rather than Sun. Justin Sun won the lunch date with noted crypto-sceptic Warren Buffett after bidding $4.57 million in a charity auction. Despite bidding more than $1 million more than the previous record-winning bid, many thought his efforts would be in vain. Warren Buffett will sip a cherry coke and say: ""thank you for your donations, Justin"". — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) June 3, 2019  Undeterred however, Sun promised to enlist ‘all of the blockchain leaders’ in his quest to convince Buffett of cryptocurrency’s value. Luckily, $4.57 million paid for more than just a single seat at the table, and Sun can take up to seven guests with him. Charlie Lee was the creator of Litecoin, one of the first Bitcoin spin-off coins back in 2011. In December 2017 he sold all of his LTC holdings, citing a potential conflict of interest, to focus on managing the altcoin. Over the past week, Litecoin has been performing incredibly well, as a looming reward halving causes FOMO. Lee certainly has the knowledge and experience to bring to the table, when it comes to promoting the benefits of crypto. However, although he will be the first guest to join the group, he isn’t the first person Sun asked. That honour went to Binance CEO, Changpeng (CZ) Zhao, who unfortunately had to decline the offer. With Charlie Lee considered a safe pair of hands by most in the crypto-community, it remains to be seen who else Sun will invite along. After all, there are another six chairs to fill. Will he stick with respected voices in the world of cryptocurrency and investing; the usual suspects who get invited onto TV panel discussions on crypto? Names such as Anthony Pompliano, Barry Silbert, Tim Draper, or Mike Novogratz. Perhaps that would be the obvious choice; appealing to Buffett through arguments that he can (or should) understand. But wouldn’t it be fun if he went a bit left field with his choices? What about someone with the more mainstream appeal of Jack Dorsey? Or the softer side of cryptocurrency’s hardcore, Brenna Sparks? I’d like to think that the often alternative perspective of John McAfee would also be a welcome addition. But I fear Buffett would too easily dismiss his opinions as those of a madman, without truly listening. Mind you, if it’s televised… Who else would you like to see attend the Warren Buffett lunch?

As Bitcoinist reported last week, June 21 sees publication of new material from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) aimed at cryptocurrencies.  Set to affect what the organization calls “virtual asset service providers” – exchanges, asset managers and more – the FATF’s suggestion has already gained the support of G20 members, and will impact around 200 countries in total.  Since hinting about its plans late last year, the FATF has gained considerable criticism from cryptocurrency sources who see a lack of understanding about how cryptocurrency transactions work.  Specifically, demands for exchanges and others to collect and store data about the sender and recipient of transactions are all but impossible to fulfil. “The people trying to understand Bitcoin are not consulting with anyone who actually understands it and who can put it into a proper context. Bitcoin is not a bank. It is not SWIFT. It is not money. It is just a database,” Azteco CEO, Akin Fernandez commented on Twitter. Ahead of the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan on June 28, a selection of crypto exchanges will meet with representatives of the FATF in order to voice concerns about its requirements.  The exact nature of the plans remains unclear, with executives seemingly upbeat about the meeting serving as an opportunity for clarification.  “Direct conversations with FATF to clarify the unique natures (sic) of the crypto industry will help to build a mutual understanding of regulatory exposure, and find industry wide solutions to manage such exposures,” Elaine Sun, chief compliance officer at Huobi Group, told financial news outlet FN June 17. Fernandez had previously echoed calls to circumvent the FATF, arguing it would be in the interests of G20 nations such as the US. “This is America’s chance to lead the entire world in the adoption of Bitcoin,” he added. It would mean US companies were the bankers of billions around the world who use Bitcoin services. Mandating that this should not happen at all is short sighted and very unwise. The meetup appears conspicuous, even garnering its own name, the V20. On Monday, Bitcoin price 00 had completed a full reversal of its previous downward correction from $9000, hitting new highs not seen since May last year.

According to The Korea Herald, Bithumb and four other exchanges in South Korea have updated their terms of service (ToS) to reflect a new directive from the country’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC). This new corrective recommendation stipulates that exchange platforms be liable for issues caused by hacks or system downtime even if such didn’t occur as a result of negligence on the part of the exchanges themselves. Bithumb’s previous ToS indemnified the platform from any losses due to events beyond its control. This new protocol is likely due to the rampant cyberattacks suffered by bitcoin exchanges in South Korea. Numerous reports indicate that state-sponsored cybercrime syndicates from North Korea are responsible for these hacks. Security experts believe that Pyongyang is funneling the proceeds of these exchange hacks into its nuclear weapons programs.  Bithumb, in particular, has been a victim of such hacks with two separate attacks between June 2018 and March 2019. In total, hackers managed to steal more than $45 million. At the time of the March 2019 hack, there were reports that the attack might have been an inside job. In its Q4 2018 crypto anti-money laundering report, CipherTrace identified internally-orchestrated cryptocurrency heists as one of the emerging risk factors in the industry. In Japan, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) has directed all exchanges to improve their cold wallet security protocols. This move is to prevent bad actors from within the exchanges to successfully steal stored funds. Bithumb and many other South Korean exchanges will be hoping for better financial performance in 2019. Last year, three of the ‘big four’ bitcoin exchanges recorded losses with only Upbit recording a positive annual bottom-line figure. Bithumb was the worst performing of the lot, recording a net loss in excess of $180 million. The platform’s losses even exceeded that of Korbit and Coinone combined as they both recorded $40 million and $5 million respectively. Apart from the hacks suffered by the likes of Bithumb, the 2018 bear market also caused steep declines in their revenue earnings. With the trend reversal in this year’s bull market, these platforms should be expecting healthier revenue figures. Do you think antitrust regulators in other jurisdictions will direct bitcoin exchanges to adopt similar protocols?

Data from monitoring resource Coin Dance reveals that in the seven days ending June 15, Venezuelans transacted over 46 billion sovereign bolivars (VES) on P2P Bitcoin exchange Localbitcoins.  The figure stands far above the previous record of 40.9 billion VES set earlier in May.  As Bitcoinist has frequently reported, the ongoing Bitcoin activity in Venezuela has become an indictment of the VES, which began circulating in August 2018. Under the regime of president Nicolas Maduro, the previous bolivar saw five zeros disappear from its exchange rate overnight, a controversial move which laid the foundation for the issuance of similarly dubious national cryptocurrency Petro.  In BTC terms, Venezuelans are not exchange substantially more value. From a VES perspective, however, the week-on-week growth is immediately obvious.  Hyperinflation has plagued the currency since its inception, with annual rates forecast to reach a giant 8 million percent in 2019. This week, Maduro again rejigged the VES, issuing new banknotes in larger denominations to counter its constantly slipping value.  Venezuela’s central bank claimed the move was in order to “make the payment system more efficient and facilitate commercial transactions,” yet there was little sign of appreciation from consumers, who appeared to take the new notes as government surrender to hyperinflation. Ineptos, están reconociendo la hiperinflación que hay dentro de poco harán otra reconversión, es un círculo vicioso — Gustavo Rodriguez Villegas (@GustavoAndresR_) June 13, 2019  Others pointed out the irony of re-adding zeros to a currency which had previously lost them.  Elsewhere, the BTC price uptick, which set in towards the end of last week, appeared to spur renewed enthusiasm on the part of traders in countries such as Argentina, Colombia and Peru. The latter two have seen increasing exposure to the Venezuela crisis with reports now surfacing that officials are attempting to tighten border controls to stem to flow of refugees.  Last week also saw a suggestion from Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, that Latin America should introduce its own version of the euro.  Commenting after he cancelled a project aimed at integrating Brazil’s native Indian population using cryptocurrency, Bolsonaro publicly stated he simply “did not know” what Bitcoin is other than being a “virtual currency.” Argentina, as Bitcoinist noted, has been more progressive, the country’s leader even conducting talks with billionaire investor and Bitcoin bull Tim Draper earlier this year. Part of the talks included Draper making a bet about the exchange of the Argentinian peso. What do you think about Venezuela’s Bitcoin trading? Let us know in the comments below!

Data from Blockchain.com shows that the Bitcoin network hash rate – the computing power required for securing the network – topped 62 quintillion hashes per second (62 million tera hashes per second – TH/s) this past Friday.  This figure represents the highest ever hash rate value recorded on the network with the previous record being 61.9 million TH/s achieved in late August 2018. The network achieving a new hash rate ATH is in keeping with the trend observed at the start of 2019, with the figures steadily increasing over every 7-day average period. More mining nodes are active on the network creating greater security by reducing the possibility of malicious attacks on the blockchain. The 51% attack on Bitcoin Cash put in stark relief, the dangers of low hash rate figures in a blockchain network. Reaching a new hash rate ATH also likely delivers a final blow to any talk of mining capitulation that emerged when the hash rate fell by more than 45% in December. The network hash rate is but one of many core fundamentals that are currently enjoying positive growth trends. Bitcoin’s active daily addresses are back above 1 million. The increased daily doesn’t seem to have materially impacted transactions fees as the mean transaction charge is somewhere around $1.33. Using wallets with robust fee calculation figures even provide much lower fees.

As pointed out by Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, network fundamentals are the best indicators of BTC price movements.

But would we be better off putting our money on that… or Bitcoin? [hint: the answer’s Bitcoin] The new normal is that there is no normal… so Bitcoin is back to normal. Just when we’d got comfortable consolidating for a while around the $8000-mark, the market starts to shake things up again. Admittedly, we had just seen the biggest weekly loss since December 2018, but that was on the back of May’s spectacular pump. Analysts were split as to whether we would see a further move downwards or bounce back up. But by Wednesday, Fundstrat was calling time on the retracement, citing positive technical indicators.  Sure enough, bitcoin price 00 then found itself in a rising wedge to $8200. A short squeeze followed, seeing further gains and a target of $8.5k. For most other asset classes, a 12.5% gain over the space of a couple of days might signal time for a breather and some consolidation. But Bitcoin being Bitcoin, it wasn’t done yet. Sensing weakness in the bears, the bulls continued to push, eyeing $9k as a weekend target. On the back of the gains, Weiss ratings upgraded Bitcoin to a ‘B’ overall, but it seems even that wasn’t the end of the story. In the early hours of this morning, BTC continued to storm ahead. A 13-month high of $9380 was achieved, leaving only a 7% gap (and some resistance at $9.6k) until we hit 5-figures. So as long as we don’t get comfortable with these gains as being normal (prompting the market to once again confound our expectations), we could easily see $10k in the next week. Titanic Tron shill, Justin Sun, fessed up that he might be in over his head in trying to convince titanic Bitcoin-sceptic Warren Buffett, of the joys of cryptocurrencies over lunch. Luckily he gets to take a bunch of friends with him, and plans on inviting along ‘all the blockchain leaders.’  One can certainly imagine Buffett dismissing Sun without a second thought, so it’ll be interesting to see who joins him.

Fears over the hated extradition bill, whose introduction the Hong Kong government has only suspended but declined to withdraw, are causing the wealthy to start moving their capital from Hong Kong to offshore. People in Hong Kong vehemently oppose a proposed bill, which would give authorities the power to deport those suspected of crimes to mainland China.  In protest, Hongkongers have been staging massive street demonstrations for several days, with varying degrees of violence. These demonstrations have caused widespread alarm, particularly for both government and business. On June 10, 2019, the US State Department warned that “the amendments could damage Hong Kong’s business environment and subject our citizens residing in or visiting Hong Kong to China’s capricious judicial system.” Moreover, the city is already suffering from liquidity problems, fueled in part by the China-U.S. trade war. Many now fear that if the extradition bill passes, it will increase capital outflows, thus further reducing liquidity. As a consequence, rich people are now focusing on how to move their wealth offshore. According to Reuters, Some Hong Kong tycoons have started moving personal wealth offshore as concern deepens over a local government plan to allow extraditions of suspects to face trial in China for the first time, according to financial advisers, bankers and lawyers familiar with such transactions. In addition, many middle-class Hongkongers are withdrawing their money from Chinese banks in protest. Even if you don't listen to the people, maybe you should listen to the money.Middle-class taking money out of Chinese banks in anger at #ExtraditionBill … could this be the start of a new spontaneous campaign?https://t.co/g21xAKVArz — Yuen Chan (@xinwenxiaojie) June 12, 2019  For many, these events explain in part Bitcoin’s present trajectory towards the $9,000 USD price mark. Hong Kong authorities are now backing down. However, they are not withdrawing the bill. On June 14, 2019, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced that she was suspending the extradition bill she was trying to push through the Hong Kong Legislative Council. But the mere suspension of the bill does not satisfy protesters. Therefore, they will go ahead with another massive demonstration on Sunday, June 16. Thus, Lam’s latest move will not remove uncertainty from the political and business environment for a long time because she has not set a date for the next step forward. Earlier this week Bitcoinist reported that Hong Kong is already seeing an uptick in Bitcoin trading volume on LocalBitcoins platform.  If the political unrest continues, it will likely further encourage the rich and the middle-class to protect their assets by moving it elsewhere from the former British colony. Hong Kongers, therefore, may already be eyeing the world’s first apolitical and borderless store of wealth, i.e. Bitcoin, to prevent the government from tracking their private data and confiscating their wealth. In fact, China is no stranger to paying a premium for cryptocurrencies to not only trade and invest but also as a means to circumvent capital controls. In October 2018, a Chinese court issued a ruling saying there is no prohibition on owning and transferring bitcoin in China. Will some wealthy Hong Kongers choose Bitcoin to protect their wealth?

Aaron Brown, the author of a recently published op-ed in Bloomberg, believes that the next sustained Bitcoin rally could be more measured as it will be propelled by fundamentals and global financial events rather than FOMO.  According to Brown, the boom and bust nature of the cryptocurrency market is not likely to change immediately and if future price action mirrors previous bull markets then Bitcoin could rise to $60,000 to $400,000 before declining sharply.  Brown argues that the last two rallies in 2013 and 2017 were primarily driven by retail investors and that 2019 is different as the current $260 billion cryptocurrency market cap is much larger than it was in 2013 ($1 billion) and 2015 ($3 billion).  Furthermore, today there are significantly more cryptocurrency investors and in 2018 more than $30 billion of institutional and investment capital went toward building new platforms.  There is also more clarity on the regulatory front and with major institutions like Facebook, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Fidelity investing in the sector, Bitcoin’s price action could be more measured in 2019.  Though the overall landscape appears robust, Brown cautions that this does not negate the possibility of a bubble and crash but as the sector matures so does the possibility of the market providing ‘predictable’ returns with the occasional 20% correction instead of the drastic 85% corrections which typically take place at the end of Bitcoin’s bull cycles. Looking into Bitcoin options data provides a little foresight into how Bitcoin price 00 action could differ in 2019. In November 2017 Bitcoin contracts traded with an implied volatility above 300% and investors believed there was a 25% chance that Bitcoin could gain above $10,000.  Currently, BTC is nearly the same price it was around November 2017 and the same contract sells at approximately an 85% implied volatility which means there is a 15% chance of Bitcoin overtaking $10,000 in a month.  Accordingly, if Bitcoin reaches $10,000 then the expected high is around $11,000 and if it does not then the expected price is around $7,500. While this is a risky bet, it pales in comparison to the risk investors took on in 2017. Bitcoin’s correlation to the S&P 500 Index also provides some guidance on 2019 price action. When the correlation is closer to zero for a quarter, Bitcoin tends to average high returns in the following quarter but volatility also increases.  On the other hand, when Bitcoin responds to market fundamentals, regardless of the correlation, the average returns tend to be lower or even negative.   As shown by the chart above, Bitcoin’s current correlation with the S&P 500 is near -0.2 and this is an area where volatility has not reached extremes in the past. Brown also pointed out that since mid-2018 Bitcoin’s correlation to the S&P 500 only hovered near zero for a couple of months in the first few months of 2019 whereas the correlations were near zero from September 2017 to January 2018.   According to Brown, Bitcoin appears to flip between positive and negative correlations with the S&P500 and intense price increases tend to occur when the correlation is near zero.  For this reason, Brown believes that the upcoming cycle could be different and he expects that over the summer prices will react to news about market fundamentals instead of FOMO.

Speaking in an interview with Quartz on June 14, Dorsey, who has made a name for himself as a Bitcoin advocate, said that the world was in a unique position to change the financial system. Blockchain-based cryptocurrency, he said, would be that change.  “This is our one opportunity to align every community, and every country, around the world, which I think provides a lot of clarity, enables a lot more innovation, and most importantly, creates a probability of much greater access for more people,” he told the publication. Bitcoin is enjoying a resurgence in public consciousness on the back of two months of price rally and increased media attention.  For Dorsey, cryptocurrency is one of just two “big secular trends” in worldwide finance – and Bitcoin, with its “amazing brand,” will take the poll position. The other trend is a shift toward algorithm deployment.  “Because (BTC) is a scarce resource, it has a probability of always increasing in value, which makes you consider a lot more how you spend it,” he continued.  Because you know that spending it today—it might go up in a week. And purchasing coffee, or a new sofa, with that really puts everything in perspective. Do I really need this? So from a psychological perspective, I think that’s interesting. As Bitcoinist reported, Dorsey became revered among cryptocurrency users this year when he joined in and publicized a transaction relay to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bitcoin Lightning Network.  Subsequently, he revealed plans to integrate cryptocurrency functionality in both Square and Twitter, the former having offered a Bitcoin wallet in its Cash app since 2018. A dedicated off-shoot dubbed ‘Square Crypto’ has also appeared.  Asked about alternatives to Bitcoin, Dorsey used his latest interview to deliver a snub to centralized cryptocurrencies, specifically the secretive token under development at Facebook. “…We need a currency for the internet. And the internet being an entity that isn’t controlled by any company or any one government, that is for the world and for the people of the world,” he said.  That is what I would want to help make happen. I would hope that all private companies can see the value of having a stateless currency that all people can access, and is not bounded or constrained by any one corporate entity. As Bitcoinist noted, new global regulations targeting cryptocurrency exchange have received condemnation for their inability to understand decentralized blockchains such as Bitcoin.

However, it still recommends holding out for a price correction before buying. The, perhaps most respected, independent ratings agency, Weiss rates cryptocurrencies based on four factors, technology, adoption, risk, and reward. These are often split to give two ratings, one for tech/adoption, and one for risk/reward. A combined average of these is used to work out an overall rating. Bitcoin’s tech/adoption score has been rated a solid ‘A’ for some time now, largely thanks to improvements such as Lightning network. The risk factor has always dragged it, and all cryptocurrency, down. However, recent price gains have improved the reward, bumping risk/reward up to a ‘C-‘, and giving Bitcoin an overall rating of ‘B’  So Bitcoin rules the roost, according to Weiss. After ten years at the top, the grand-daddy of all cryptocurrencies still sets the standard by which others are measured. But despite the upgraded rating, vastly improved adoption, and significant technological evolution, Weiss doesn’t recommend buying bitcoin at the moment. The reason? Bitcoin’s success is its downfall; those recent price gains have led Weiss to anticipate a “substantial price correction.” After which, we are recommended to “buy with funds we can afford to risk” Bitcoin is now rated 'B'. Our recommendation: Wait for a substantial price correction. Then buy with funds you can afford to risk. Find out more details about our rating of BTC: žhttps://t.co/gbQDRwVsTx#BTC #Bitcoin #WeissRatings #crypto #cryptocurrency — Weiss Ratings (@WeissRatings) June 13, 2019  That’s a far more conservative message than the ‘best buying opportunity since 2015’ that it heralded last month. But Weiss still says that we are enjoying the first phase of a new bull market, and that risk/reward rating will continue to improve as a sustainable bull market unfolds. So, Weiss tweeted a positive development for Bitcoin. Surely nobody can be upset or offended by that? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Well, there was one section of the crypto community which had something to say about the matter. Can anyone guess who it might have been? Yep, the Ripple army seems to have taken Weiss’s tweet as a personal affront.

So it’s really no surprise that cryptocurrency is about to explode in South Korea.  South Koreans have consistently had a big appetite for Bitcoin, at times even paying above market price for it known as the Kimchi Premium. According to a report by intelligence firm Cindicator, recent regulation, the burgeoning cryptocurrency exchange scene, and the country’s history and culture are all key factors when it comes to BTC acceptance.   In fact, South Koreans already make up some 30% of total cryptocurrency trading globally. On top of that, around 30% of all salaried workers own crypto assets of some kind and trade with varying degrees of frequency.  The government also allocated 1 trillion won (USD 880 million) to spend on blockchain development in 2019, creating a ripe climate for Bitcoin adoption. Moreover, Bitcoinist reported yesterday that South Korea’s largest bank by assets KB Kookmin took an about turn decision on cryptocurrency and will be developing custody solutions.  With all these conditions creating the perfect storm for BTC, South Korea will be key in the new bull market.

Speaking to Forbes, Zak Selbert, the Indexica CEO said bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies do not behave in a similar manner to mainstream asset classes. According to Selbert: From our extensive research, and we’ve done more testing around bitcoin and cryptocurrencies than we have for pretty much any other asset we’ve analyzed, it simply appears the bitcoin price and crypto markets just don’t respond as we would expect them to. For Selbert, the prime drivers for price trends in the stock market – major company announcements, new technology, and government regulation, seem not to have any material effect on Bitcoin.  Bitcoinist reached out to Indexica for further comments on its research. Replying via email, Selbert opined: We can typically pinpoint at least 40% of the drivers of price movement when looking in the rear view mirror, but for Bitcoin, it is rare for us to be able find the drivers of price movements. When price movements cannot be explained or identified, it means it will still be a while before the asset becomes traditional. Commenting on the matter in his daily market update, Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, put Indexica’s observations down to over-complicated research parameters for a still-developing asset class.  There isn’t nearly enough information required to develop the “fully realized market metrics” used to design predictive models for stocks, commodities, etc. However, for Greenspan, to say that nothing moves the crypto market would be inaccurate. Using simple technical indicators like trend lines and observing fundamentals like network activity and adoption provide insight into price action, especially for BTC/USD. Short-term sentiment can cause momentum changes at different points in time. The surges or drops that occur from such events are usually ephemeral with the price action reverting back to its previous state. In the early days, exchange hacks and negative government regulations regularly impacted the market. In present times, however, such events no longer affect the BTC price even on positive news. The growing consensus is that Bitcoin has become a more mature asset since the mostly hype-driven 2017 bull run. In that time, BTC fell 80%, experienced massive institutional interest and is now beginning to chip away at its 2018 decline. According to the Indexica research, text documents concerning now contain similar language as can be seen for more mainstream asset classes. The Indexica team say this trend represents a “coming of age” for BTC. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital believes the next 12 to 18 months will be pivotal for BTC. Pompliano joins the likes of others like Max Keiser and Travis Kling to posit that dovish central bank policies will put the global economy into a tailspin and send Bitcoin price to new all-time highs.

In a blog post June 13, Adam White, Bakkt’s COO and original employee of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, named July 22 as the date user testing will finally begin. “On July 22, two days after Apollo 11’s 50th anniversary, Bakkt will initiate user acceptance testing for its bitcoin futures listed and traded at ICE Futures U.S. and cleared at ICE Clear US,” he confirmed.  The announcement has been long coming. Bakkt, which billed itself as a game-changing cryptocurrency ecosystem for institutional investors when executives announced it in August last year, has faced multiple delays.  Regulatory uncertainty – the very headache Bakkt’s team wishes to solve – often lay at the heart of decisions to postpone launching any products.  Bitcoin futures will form the first of many offerings, but it remains unknown when a full rollout of the service will commence.  The scheduling of the pilot phase is in itself timely, however, coming the week fellow futures provider CME Group announced record volume for its product. In May, Bitcoinist reported, CME futures passed $500 million in implied USD value. Moreover, today saw the launch of Cryptoindex, a new cryptocurrency index to allow traders using Reuters, Bloomberg, and TradingView terminals to access information on Bitcoin as well as other 100 top-performing digital tokens and cryptocurrencies. At the same time, CBOE, the first Bitcoin futures provider in the world, will shut down its operation when its last contracts settle later this month.  Curiously, executives had blamed poor performance for partly informing their decision, which went public just weeks before BTC markets saw an abrupt and sustained bull run from $4000 to over $9000.  “Bakkt may be a form of moonshot, but it’s grounded in an earthbound endeavor to support the future of finance and the adoption of blockchain technology,” White continued.  In its own way, Bakkt’s efforts to help institutions launch safely into this market is the right stuff for the future. The future may yet produce surprises, even in the short term. As Bitcoinist noted, new recommendations from the intergovernmental organization, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), will place stringent new reporting requirements on crypto-related businesses.  Affecting 200 countries, all G20 nations have pledged to uphold the requirements, which have gained intense criticism in recent weeks. By trying to treat exchanges like banks, the FATF, opponents argue, has comprehensively failed to understand how cryptocurrency transactions work.  What do you think about Bakkt launching testing?

Although not without a bit of good-natured trolling on Twitter first. Twitter and Square CEO, Jack Dorsey, is a big fan of Bitcoin. We know this because a/ he doesn’t stop going on about it, and b/ see a/. In 2017 he introduced an easy on-ramp into Square’s Cash App, allowing users to buy and sell Bitcoin directly within the app. This led the Cash app to become the top ranking finance app on the Apple App Store today. Back in March, he made a commitment to the wider Bitcoin and open source ecosystem. He would ‘give back’ to the community for the valuable contribution Square had gained through its use. This was to be in the form of hiring a team of developers and designers, to work on open source projects to benefit Bitcoin, not Square. With much fanfare, Square Crypto launched its Twitter account with a call for recommendations. ‘Who (other than yourself),’ it asked, ‘should we hire?’ And that was pretty much it. Since then the account has tweeted ‘pseudo-philosophy’, ‘witty’ asides, and the occasional meme, all with a Bitcoin bent. It is purported to be written by “four black cats using a WiFi-connected Ouija board.” Until yesterday… The account’s first tweet in over a fortnight read: Hey guys. Management here. It seems the cats discovered catnip. While they’re vision questing, please welcome our summer intern and inaugural hire, Gary Fuches. Let’s give Gary a warm crypto welcome. Then came a message from Mr. Fuches, himself, proclaiming the strength of his love for… blockchain? Hello everybody! My name's Gary and I'm here to say, I love blockchain in a very big way!!! — Square Crypto (@sqcrypto) June 12, 2019  Needless to say, this got the fans in a froth. The most popular comment on this post was “Bitcoin, not blockchain.” Thankfully, Square Crypto revealed their troll-ery just 12 minutes later, before things descended into violence, posting: Hey guys. Management again. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out with Gary. However, we think we’ve found somebody who can live up to his commitment to decentralization. Please welcome Steve Lee, aka @moneyball, to the Square Crypto team. Steve is a former product director at Google, an angel investor, and a volunteer project manager, helping to drive Bitcoin adoption through open-source development. His first tweet was “Bitcoin, not blockchain. Very excited about this opportunity!” So everybody was happy again. Will Square Crypto help boost Bitcoin’s ecosystem?

According to Bloomberg, the Fundstrat technical strategist expects an end to the price retracement that has been going on since the end of May 2019. In a note to investors quoted by Bloomberg, Sluymer wrote: Another upside attempt appears to be developing for most cryptocurrencies. Increase exposure. We expect Bitcoin to stage another rally from current levels toward next resistance between $8,800-$9,000. Sluymer’s forecast comes from a reversal in the bitcoin relative strength index (RSI). The Fundstrat analyst says momentum has shifted from negative/neutral, towards a more positive trajectory.  Bitcoin price 00 gained more than $3,000 in May, breaking beyond $6,000 before flaming out at $9,100. With BTC refusing to fall even further below the mid-$7k region even with the ‘CME gap’, there is a growing narrative that bitcoin has found a new support level at $8,000. The $9,000 resistance level will prove crucial in determining whether BTC can make a run for $10k before the start of Q3 2019. BTC/USD could yet fail to stay above $9,000 which might be the catalyst for the next 20-30% price decline. Bitcoin’s early June run saw it fall by about 10 percent – the largest weekly loss for bitcoin since plummeting to $3,100 in December 2018. Tether recently added a fresh supply of ‘newly minted’ $150 million in USDT. BTC price has historically responded positively to fresh injections of Tether funds. Apart from bitcoin, Sluymer also picked Litecoin as an interesting proposition in the short-term, especially with its upcoming halving. LTC gains appear to have cooled slightly over the past 24 hours but were up more than 33% in the week prior. Sluymer expects slight pullbacks as the 4th-ranked crypto approaches the $145 resistance point. Litecoin is up more than 350% since the start of the year and its current price of $135 is the highest since May 2018.

As Blockchain investor Oliver Isaacs noted June 13, CME Group’s Bitcoin futures set new records for both volume and open interest last month.  A total of $515 million in notional value was traded, a surge of more than a third since April and 250 percent more year on year. This, Reuters reported citing various crypto business’ performance, is further proof Bitcoin’s 2019 renaissance has transformed perceptions of a market which held little faith even six months ago. The largest cryptocurrency is “growing up,” says the publication, quoting the record volume in CME Group’s BTC futures market.  “It’s logical they (institutional investors) would want to be moving in this direction, especially considering their size and how much more there is at stake,” Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Exchange Group added accompanying comments.  Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, was similarly buoyed by the futures data. “This is very bullish as… the rise in (Bitcoin) futures volume reflects incremental institutional money,” he wrote on Twitter.  As Bitcoinist frequently noted in recent weeks, the Bitcoin network’s fundamental metrics are combining to give the impression the current price strengthening is more reliable than any previous bull run.  Optimists hope that the advances seen in April and May are the tip of an iceberg which researchers identify as a new phase in Bitcoin’s history – one that could even take it to supremacy over fiat competitors such as Visa and MasterCard. For institutional investors wanting in on BTC, however, this year’s increasing entry was down to regulatory changes accompanying a price uptick, Sui Chung, head of cryptocurrency pricing products at Crypto Facilities said.  “This is the first time those stars have aligned,” he told Reuters.  Yet the picture is not entirely rosy. As Bitcoinist reported, further upcoming regulatory hurdles could soon put the brakes on investor enthusiasm. The dampener comes in the form of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which has pledged to publish its cryptocurrency recommendations for 200 countries later this month.  Criticized as ill thought out and even “absurd,” the guidance will aim to treat exchanges and associated businesses in an identical way to banks, despite the chalk-and-cheese differences between banking and Bitcoin transactions. In an ironically timely move, CBOE, the first entity to offer Bitcoin futures trading in December 2017, will wind down its operations entirely when its last contracts expire in June.

Speaking to Bloxlive TV earlier in June, Pompliano said the next 18 months will be crucial for Bitcoin. The Morgan Creek Digital co-founder believes the plethora of developments with potentially global economic impacts will contribute to upscaling Bitcoin’s role in the global financial system. Will Bitcoin Reign as King in Times of Economic Instability? @APompliano shares his thoughts with @BloxliveTV https://t.co/0eTl8nhm1z pic.twitter.com/s0nBvqLhde — Jessica Walker 🎬🚀 (@Jessicaw_tv) June 11, 2019  Pomp drew a line linking trade tensions between the U.S. and China, dovish central bank policies and the 2020 Bitcoin halving as important drivers that will have a positive impact on BTC price. According to Pompliano: Over the next 12 to 18 months, we are going get a perfect storm for bitcoin. There are a number of events that are going to happen at the same time. Central banks will be forced into some interest rate cuts, maybe some QE. These events [will] ultimately drive Bitcoin into an ultra-bull case. Already, several market analysts warn that the current global economic trajectory is one tending towards another financial crisis. Bitcoin appears to be in prime position to ride this tumultuous economic wave, offering, as Bitcoinist called it in an op-ed late last year, “a non-political alternative to the money printing pyramid.” Monetary policymakers around the world from the Federal Reserve in the U.S. to the Bank of Japan (BOJ), and the European Central Bank (ECB) are all adopting dovish policies. There are reports of adopting rate cuts or even zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP), not to mention the seemingly permanent quantitative easing used to paper over the cracks of a deteriorating market. Bitcoin emerged after the 2008 financial crisis and the next year-and-a-half could potentially form its defining crucible. This ‘digital gold’ is already providing a suitable shelter for investors against the coming financial storm. Ironically, it is the banks themselves that could further solidify its status as the prime driver in the separation of money and state.  If the separation of church and state opened the way for religious and political freedom, Bitcoin proponents argue that a politically-neutral, opt-in monetary system could do the same for economic freedom. In other words, it can do to money what the internet did for information. Bitcoin in many ways has the ability to ‘scale trust’ in society by completely removing it from the equation. This will be particularly important when it comes to transferring and storing value compared to the ‘full faith and credit’ fiat money that has been holding the global financial system hostage. Bitcoin will hopefully be a fully realized store of value when, not if, the credit bubble inevitably bursts. What is your bitcoin price prediction for the year ending 2020?

Provide Absurd Evidence']","  Anja van Oosterhout | Jun 12, 2019 | 13:00 Intergovernmental body the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has committed to making 200 countries treat cryptocurrency exchanges like banks. As Bloomberg reported June 11, an update to how national regulators should treat businesses dealing with cryptocurrency tokens will officially go public on the 21st of the month.  Its impact is not entirely clear, but experts are already warning that anyone – be it a business or a private investor – who exchanges more than $B1000 or €1000 worth of crypto will have to provide personal information.  For businesses such as exchanges and asset managers, the requirements stipulate the recipient of funds must also be identified – something many have insisted is impossible with decentralized cryptocurrencies.  The FATF can only make ‘recommendations,’ and their application is a matter for each jurisdiction’s authorities. Those countries which do not comply can face blacklisting, however, and even removal from the global financial system. “Their recommendation could have a much larger impact than the SEC or any other regulator has had to date,” Eric Turner, director of research at crypto research firm Messari, told Bloomberg about the potential changes in the US. Turner added the issue was “one of the biggest threats to crypto today.” As Bitcoinist reported, the FATF announced an incremental approach to cryptocurrency management in October last year.  “As part of a staged approach, the FATF will prepare updated guidance on a risk-based approach to regulating virtual asset service providers, including their supervision and monitoring; and guidance for operational and law enforcement authorities on identifying and investigating illicit activity involving virtual assets,” its president, Marshall Billingslea, said at the time. “…By June, we will issue additional instructions on the standards and how we expect them to be enforced.” Two months later, G20 members pledged to implement the organization’s suggestions in full, a stance it repeated this month.  As the deadline approached, cryptocurrency figures were already sounding the alarm, noting the apparent ineptitude on the part of FATF bureaucrats attempting to apply banking rules to Bitcoin 00 and others.  “The people trying to understand Bitcoin are not consulting with anyone who actually understands it and who can put it into a proper context,” Azteco CEO, Akin Fernandez, commented on Twitter in May.  Uploading an image of how a Bitcoin transaction contrasts with a bank-to-bank one, he added: Bitcoin is not a bank. It is not SWIFT. It is not money. It is just a database. When you accept this, the above image looks totally absurd. What do you think about the FATF’s new recommendations?

The theory stems from a Reddit post made in 2013, by a user named Luke Magnotta. In it, he claimed to be a time traveler from the year 2025 and gave a detailed description of how Bitcoin had created a political dystopia. Part of the post detailed the rise in bitcoin price up until 2013, and how it would continue to rise in the future. Essentially it stated that the approximate tenfold increases each year would slow down to occur every two years. So the sequence of $0.1 – 2010, $1 – 2011, $10 – 2012, $100 – 2013, would continue as follows: $1000 in 2015, $10,000 in 2017, $100,000 in 2019, and $1 million in 2021. Well, that’s what most believe, and that was certainly the theme of (at least) that segment of the show. Of of the other panelists explained the Avril Lavigne conspiracy theory; that she didn’t just sell-out her skate-punk roots, but instead died in 2003, and was replaced by a more pop-friendly double.  But it has recently gained media attention again, with certain groups suggesting that the prediction is coming true. I mean, it demonstrably isn’t true, as bitcoin price crossed the $100 mark and hit $1000 in 2013, just a few months after the post was made. But bear with me… In very general terms, if you squint your eyes a bit, and just glance at it momentarily. Ignoring obvious bubbles, bitcoin securely passed the $1000 hurdle on 2nd January 2016. That’s very almost 2015. And bitcoin certainly crossed the $10,000 mark in 2017… if we consider 2018 to be an over-correction and $10k to be an inherent value. Critics of the ‘Bitcoin Time Traveler’ theory point out that, if a time traveler had actual knowledge, would he not give exact prices rather than a rough schematic of gains. Which is a fair enough point. However, potential self-cannibalist, John McAfee, sees it as some form of vilification. In a recent tweet, he drew attention to the story, noting that 2021 is just one day away from his predicted $1 million bitcoin date of 31st December 2020. I'm not the only madman in crypto apparently. $1 mil prediction by 2021 by the man who has never been wrong in his predictions.. 2021 us just one day away from my prediction  of $1 mil by 12/31/2020.https://t.co/9dafiU4P9R — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 28, 2019  Mind you, in 2021 the dollar apparently isn’t used any more, so maybe it’s a moot point? So, could Luke Magnotta be a real time-traveler? Is he really here to save us from a future they intend to nuke (as the original post goes on to claim)? Or is this just some early FUD, potentially created by a forward-looking central bank already running scared? I guess we just wait and see. What do you think about the Bitcoin time traveler theory?

According to various reports surfacing on social media this week, participants in the ongoing rallies against the Hong Kong government are choosing to abandon payment methods which could track them. A planned law dubbed the ‘Extradition Bill’ wants to make it possible to send suspects to mainland China. This, the protesters say, would open up Hong Kong’s legal system to manipulation and for Beijing. Fresh from the 2014 ‘Umbrella Movement’ pro-democracy events, citizens are now all too aware of the need to protect their identity in the face of a government with an increasing reputation for surveillance and intrusion.  “We’re afraid of having our data tracked,” a female protester told QZ reporter Mary Hui. Hui was at a metro station in Hong Kong and noticed long lines at ticket machines “stretching back 10+ meters.” There is usually never a line at the train ticketing machines. Judging from an overheard convo, it appears that people are reluctant to use their rechargeable Octopus cards for fear of leaving a paper trail of them having been present at the protest. pic.twitter.com/s1rsgSnCqL — Mary Hui (@maryhui) June 12, 2019  The machines are normally empty, she said, as passengers use rechargeable smartcards which can be topped up in various ways. Now, however, with 2014 still in their minds, they appreciate the need for privacy when it comes to money. “She said that this ticket-buying (wasn’t) as prevalent during the 2014 Umbrella Movement. Five years on, however, people are more wary & aware,” Hui summarized on Twitter. As Bitcoinist has reported, multiple governments have declared a ‘war on cash’ as part of efforts to standardize their countries’ economies. While authorities say such measures reduce crime, opponents argue it leaves the door open to full control of the financial system and opportune intrusion into citizens’ financial lives for any purpose. A recent case in point is India, where the central bank is actively pursuing a digitization plan which has already seen shambolic currency reform and widespread backlash from consumers.  Hong Kong, however, provides a rare example of broad public understanding of the benefits of cash and how states could use money to persecute. “This raises a lot of interesting questions about cash vs. cashless societies, and how in times of protest people may drastically adjust their usual economic behavior,” Hui added. The protests predictably shook up the Hong Kong dollar (HKD), which has gained against the USD in recent days due to a liquidity squeeze sending investors long, Bloomberg reports.  The government has in fact spent $2.8 billion since March maintaining HKD’s peg with the USD, with concerns about financial policy compounded by the political events. “We don’t trust China. Rules and laws can be arbitrarily applied and we can see this in Hong Kong already,” a protester told UK publication The Guardian, adding that should the Extradition Bill pass, he would immediately convert his savings to USD.  Bitcoin trade volumes meanwhile have shown a modest uptick on P2P platform Localbitcoins over the past several weeks. A local Bitcoin company has joined the protests and given all its employees the day off. #ExtraditionBill pic.twitter.com/AFWUuDDFWg — Leo Weese 獅草地 (@LeoAW) June 12, 2019  It should be noted that Hong Kong has the largest number of Bitcoin ATMs in Asia, while the local industry appears naturally supportive of the protests.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is up 720,000,000% in its short 10-year history since its first recorded price.  Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate holding company, the CEO of which is no other but popular investor and one of the richest men alive, Warren Buffett, has seen an increase of 997,900 percent in its stock price since the prominent investor took control of it back in 1964. The company is also well-known for the fact that it has been under the leadership of one of the most well-known investors, Warren Buffett. He is currently the CEO at Berkshire Hathaway. Forbes’ latest listicle of the richest men puts Buffett as the third wealthiest man with an estimated net worth of $82.5 billion. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has only been around in the past decade. However, in this relatively short amount of time, the cryptocurrency has managed to increase by a whopping 720,000,000 percent since its first ever recorded price. Ironically, Buffett, being the prominent and well-known investor that he is, is a sworn Bitcoin-basher. In fact, Buffett has been particularly vocal on his stance on the matter, calling Bitcoin all sorts of things. Buffett said: It doesn’t do anything. It just sits there. It’s like a seashell or something, and that is not an investment to me. It’s a gambling device… there’s been a lot of frauds connected with it. There’s been disappearances, so there’s a lot lost on it. Bitcoin hasn’t produced anything. If that’s not definitive enough, Buffett has also called the leading cryptocurrency “rat poison squared.” Going even further, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested $340 into an alleged Ponzi-type scheme according to Bloomberg. Federal investigators maintain that DC Solar, the company which received Buffett’s backing has used new investors’ money to pay back existing investors. So if Buffett, the infallible investment genius that everyone seems to believe he is, failed to recognize a Fed-investigated Ponzi-scheme, could it be possible that he’s also wrong about Bitcoin? Regardless of whether Buffett likes it or not, this “rat poison” has massively outperformed the company he controls. It’s also worth noting that Berkshire Hathaway wholly owns prominent corporations such as Geico, Duracell, Long & Foster, and so forth. It also controls minority shares at American Express, Wells Fargo, and The Coca-Cola Company. Bitcoin does none of the above and isn’t even a company with any central authority. It’s simply a decentralized protocol for money that ensures no one breaks the rule. Bitcoin is an asset class of its own that has managed to gain 722 times more money to its investors compared to Berkshire Hathaway. And it only took it 10 years. So, in case anyone doubts John McAfee in putting a $1 million price target for Bitcoin, it’s perhaps worth considering all of the above. Sure, it may not happen by December 31st, 2020, but it’s certainly a possibility. Maybe Buffett should reconsider. Though, perhaps Justin Sun is the one (not) to make him change his mind.

So who are the top crypto lending services today? Let’s take a look. Cryptocurrencies have gone a long way in their relatively short life span. In 10 years, their total market exceeds $254 billion having plunged from an all-time high upwards of $800 billion back in 2017. Moreover, they are also seeing increasingly widespread adoption as more and more traditional industry participants are beginning to accept them as a means of payment. Hence, the number of people who got involved in the industry throughout the past 10 years has grown substantially.  Naturally, this also brings forward a variety of related services, capturing the needs of the growing audience. Cryptocurrency lending is perhaps one of the most interesting fields to discuss as these services saw a serious spike in interest and profitability despite 2018’s prolonged bear market.  With this said, let’s have a look at the three of the best cryptocurrency platforms today.  Celsius Network is perhaps one of the most recognized cryptocurrency lending platforms on the market right now.  Back in 2018, its application saw 40,000 downloads, $50 million in coin deposits and paid out maximum interest of 7.1%.  It’s worth noting that Celsius Network shares up to 80% of its entire income with its community in the form of weekly interest payments. The way it works is fairly simple. Users can earn up to 10% are allowed to receive interest on their cryptocurrency holdings as soon as they deposit it in the Celsius Network wallets. There is no minimum deposit, no withdrawal fees, and no lockups. It’s as easy as that.  The official website features a comprehensive interest calculator which shows exactly how much interest the user will be able to earn on a weekly basis depending on how much they deposit.  Users can also apply for a USD or stablecoin loan using their cryptocurrency as collateral with rates as low as 4.95% APR.  The platform supports a broad range of different cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, DASH, Ripple, and so forth.  INLOCK is another popular cryptocurrency lending platform where users are able to collateralize their holdings and take out a loan.  What’s interesting about INLOCK is that there is no centrally controlled interest rate. It operates under a peer-to-peer (P2P) model which ensures that the interest rates are determined by the dynamics of the supply and demand. What makes both parties safe is the fact that the borrower’s cryptocurrency backs up the loan entirely. This guarantees that the investment of the lender is perfectly safe.  Just as Celsius Network, INLOCK also provides the opportunity for users to offer their cryptocurrencies as loans and to receive interest on it.  BlockFi is another cryptocurrency lending platform which allows you to put your holdings to work. According to the official website, users can earn as much as 6.2% annually.  The website also reveals that the funding takes place on the same day through a stablecoin, or through a regular wire transfer. There is an available calculator which shows the interest rate users can expect to earn based on their deposit. BlockFi also provides home loans, auto loans, and the option to pay credit card debt with crypto-backed loans. Is lending becoming a vital service industry for crypto?

', 'Bitcoin vs. Offshore RMB Futures Performance ', 'Correlation, Coincidence or Something More? ']","  Ollie Leech | Jun 11, 2019 | 15:00 Bitcoin’s price has seen a dramatic resurgence of bullish support over 2019, which has allowed it to decouple away from a vast majority of traditional financial markets. But when we compare its performance to the Offshore RMB Futures market, however, we can see a striking resemblance between the two trends. Let’s take a look. Renminbi (RMB) in Mandarin translates to ‘the people’s currency’, and has been officially recognized as the currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) since 1948. The Chinese Yuan (CNY) is actually the unit of account for RMB and is not its own separate currency.   The Offshore Renminbi (RMB) market itself is a non-mainland China exchange setup originally in Hong Kong to facilitate extraterritorial trade with foreign countries. Since its inception 2003, three additional offshore RMB markets have cropped up in London, Singapore, and Taiwan.   But what’s the point? Well, by having a detached offshore market, China is able to keep its nation’s capital separate from foreign investments. This is important because not only does it safeguard the Chinese economy from recession if the world trade markets decline, but it also allows them to expand the reach of their currency to the global market.    Looking at the chart above, we can see the price performance of both Bitcoin (BTC) and the offshore RMB futures market over the last 8 months (blue and red lines respectively).   What’s surprising here, is that we can see a very clear correlation between the two trends despite both financial products – if you can even class Bitcoin as a financial ‘product’ – operating in two entirely different spheres.   When Bitcoin’s price 00 plummeted during the Bitcoin Cash ‘hash war’ in November last year, we can see that the offshore renminbi futures market followed the same steep downtrend almost exactly a month later.  Weird, right? The same similarity can be also seen when Bitcoin’s price made a strong recovery out of the bear market around April this year, only to be followed a month later by the RMB futures market again. What’s more, is that when we look at the most recent data on the chart, we can see that the RMB futures market now appears to have finally caught up with Bitcoin’s performance as both begin to correct at the exact same time.   What we can draw from this, is that it definitely seemed that Bitcoin was front running the offshore RMB market for a number of months. It could’ve been that the two markets had become intrinsically linked because the vast majority of investors in the RMB futures market, were also trading in the BTC market – which is quite possible given the popularity of Bitcoin across the Asian markets.   Once the Bitcoin market started to suffer in November, investors started to lose money. It’s likely that the bearish sentiment could’ve seeped across into the offshore RMB futures market and caused investors to exit until the global markets stabilized.   The same can be said for when Bitcoin began to recover after the crash. The renewed bullish sentiment in the crypto market could very well have encouraged RMB futures traders to return to the market – hence the spike in trades thereafter.   What do you think about this interesting correlation? Let’s us know in the comment section below!","['bitcoin', 'china', 'chinese yuan', 'Futures', 'offshore', 'Renminbi']"

Thankfully, he tweeted the results on Twitter. The top city when it comes to interest in Bitcoin is Lagos. This should really come as no surprise. Nigeria has longstanding economic woes and has consistently been one of the top countries for Google searches. Use of Bitcoin as a hedge against rampant inflation is well documented.  Interestingly, adding ‘Buy’ to make the search term ‘Buy Bitcoin’ sees Lagos top the chart by an even greater margin. There were five times as many searches for ‘Buy Bitcoin’ in Lagos than in the third-placed city, New York.  The only other city which comes close is second placed Accra in Ghana, with 73% of the searches in Lagos. So it seems like in Ghana, they want to buy bitcoin and don’t care what it is. Austria has long been punching above its weight in terms of ‘Bitcoin’ as a search term, and interest only seems to be increasing. The capital city, Vienna came second, with 70% of the number of searches from Lagos, though incredibly, with just over a tenth of the population. That means there were 7.3 times as many searches per capita in Vienna as in Lagos. Do the Viennese know something that we don’t? Now if I can just get that Ultravox song out of my head… No surprises here either. San Jose is after all, where a lot of Silicon Valleys lives. What is perhaps more surprising is the diversity of these top 3 cities and the motivating factors that drive them to the top of Google trends. Oh, and of course I now have a different song in my head. Hollywood, Venice Beach, Bitcoin, and the Beach Boys. Of course, Los Angeles ranks highly. It’s very big. We might expect that to become a theme for the rest of the list. Canada’s most populous city and its champion of Google searches for ‘Bitcoin’. CoinATMRadar lists 218 Bitcoin ATMs in and around the Toronto area. That’s more than twice as many as there are in Canada’s second largest city, Montreal. Munich saw Germany’s first legally sanctioned BATM installed just last year, and yet both Munich and Berlin feature in the top ten. The country’s interest clearly precedes its regulatory bodies. New Yorkers are possibly getting their searches in now, in fear that they may require a BitLicense to Google ‘Bitcoin’ in the future. The New York Post clearly isn’t managing to put them off. Singaporeans are so ahead of the curve that even their government invests in cryptocurrency, and the citizens of Sydney could just be checking where to spend their bitcoin on a kebab. So largely a list of major western cities, plus one major eastern city-state and one major African city. How do you interpret the data on where ‘Bitcoin’ is being Googled now?

Reported by local media outlet Business Korea June 11, Kookmin will now work with local company Atomrigs Lab, which is active in digital asset protection.  The move marks a decisive change of tack for Kookmin, which until recently appeared to have a hands-off stance on cryptocurrency in general.  South Korea continues to be a hotspot for cryptocurrency activity in areas such as trading, with mixed regulatory signals failing to dampen consumer enthusiasm this year.  “We hope that the two companies will grow together by discovering innovative services in the field of digital asset management with this agreement,” Lee Koo-il, CEO of Kookmin Bank, meanwhile commented after inking the partnership on Monday. We will expand the digital ecosystem through cooperation. The exact outcome of the joint development plans with Atomrigs remains less certain but incorporates a wide range of technologies associated with both cryptocurrency storage and Blockchain. According to Business Korea, the two will “jointly study digital asset protection technology and smart contract application methods… and opted to actively explore new business opportunities in the field of digital assets.”  “The company will also develop digital asset management services that combine Atomrigs Lab’s technology with Kookmin Bank’s internal control infrastructure and information protection technologies,” the publication continued.  In addition, the two companies have agreed to cooperate with each other in the creation of a bridge ecosystem between the blockchain network and finance. Last year, Kookmin had come under fire from South Korea regulators over its poor anti-money laundering procedures regarding transactions originating from cryptocurrency sources.  Worldwide, banks offering crypto custody solutions meanwhile looks set to become an ever-increasing trend.  Attempts thus far have taken various forms, such as Dutch lender ABN Amro’s in-house crypto wallet, which controversially stipulates the bank holds investors’ private keys.  This week, the world’s second-larger insurer Metaco announced it was now offering crypto custody insurance via a deal with Aon.  “Insurance is an essential requirement for banking clients and METACO is excited to be able to facilitate insurance for our clients through the leading broker for crypto insurance solutions,” Metaco CEO and founder Adrien Treccani commented in an accompanying press release. As Bitcoinist reported, institutional investment in Bitcoin 00 and other cryptocurrencies are expected to constitute a major phenomenon in the coming years. In May, a survey by pro-crypto asset manager Fidelity Investments revealed half of investors considered crypto a worthy sector for their portfolio.

Female adoption is at an all-time high. Although, it’s still woefully dwarfed by men, who make up over 90%. The slice of the pie taken up by women may look a little measly at 9.1%. But, let’s celebrate the small victories. This time last year, women in Bitcoin made up just 3% of all users.  The times are definitely changing, despite the lengthy bear market. There may be less retail FOMO than 2017, but Bitcoin is now distinctly more than just a word thrown around at dinner parties.  Savvy females are finding use cases for it as a store of value, payment method, and alternative banking method. Sadly, 2018 saw a slight dip in women in leadership positions despite an all-time high in 2017, when they made up 6.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs.  However, despite this drop, there is a growing number of females present on Fortune 500 boards at over 22%. There are also plenty more key female figures leading up innovation teams, tech, blockchain policy, and speaking at major events. Ok, so spotting women at blockchain conferences can be like staking out near-extinct wildlife species in the jungle. But, it is slowly beginning to change. Rome wasn’t built in a day after all.  From long-term champions like Amber Baldet, Meltem Demirors, and BitGive’s Connie Gallippi to heavyweights like Lightning Network’s Elizabeth Stark, more ladies are joining in–and leading–the conversation. bitcoin needs to take a breather. can't take a vacation when every week hits new ATHs. pic.twitter.com/mFIqDlznq5 — Meltem Demirors (@Melt_Dem) October 31, 2017  Perhaps a piqued interest from women in Bitcoin has also been aided by wider acceptance of Bitcoin and blockchain technology by major businesses. It’s no longer an unregulated and wild space if Microsoft and JPMorgan say otherwise. Then there are more women in blockchain in general, from IBM Blockchain’s General Manager Marie Wieck to Ripple’s SVP of Corporate Development Kahina Van Dyke. Bitcoin is a gender-neutral technology with no barriers to entry nor tangible reasons why female users are still so few. However, small-but-significant steps are taken almost daily.  From Microsoft Excel adding Bitcoin as a currency option on Excel to Apple adding the B symbol to its new font set, Bitcoin is gaining mindshare in females–and the greater public at large–and that’s what really counts. Will more women continue to join the Bitcoin revolution? Share your thoughts below!","['bitcoin', 'Bitcoin Adoption', 'Women in Bitcoin']"

Speaking to Yahoo! Finance in an interview June 11, Sun, who paid $4.56 million in an annual charity auction to dine with Buffett, said his own project should not form the sole focus of the meeting. “…We want this lunch to be a bridge between the cryptocurrency community and the traditional investor, so that’s why I will bring all the leaders in the… blockchain industry… to have more communication, which will benefit both sides,” he told the network.  Sun raised eyebrows when he announced his participation in the auction, which was held on eBay, earlier this month.  As Bitcoinist reported, his stance within cryptocurrency focuses heavily on publicity for the Tron platform and its associated TRX token, Sun frequently criticizing other extant networks such as altcoin leader Ethereum.  Nevertheless, the event, the date of which remains unknown, will form an interesting occasion when Buffett will be outnumbered at the negotiating table. The 88-year-old Berkshire Hathaway CEO has delivered uniquely sour verdicts on Bitcoin in recent years, variously describing it as “rat poison squared,” a “gambling device” and “not investing.” His veteran partner in crime, Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger, contributed “turds” and “freshly harvested baby brains” to the mixture.  Sun knows he will also have his work cut out, voicing doubts about the true potential for anyone to convince Buffett that cryptocurrency is worth gaining exposure to. “It might be unrealistic in just three hours to convince Warren Buffett to buy cryptocurrencies,” he said in response to a tongue-in-cheek question about using the lunch to “shill Tron.” We just want to show him the recent progress of… cryptocurrency and… blockchain technology.”\ The showdown at least has time on its side: Bitcoin price 00 has rallied once again in recent days to challenge $8000, capping overall six month gains of 136 percent.  Berkshire’s own share price history – up 127,000 percent since 1979 – already pales in comparison to the profits of an original Bitcoin investor. Since its first recorded price in 2009, as of April this year, BTC/USD was up 720 million percent.  Sun meanwhile let slip that his own stash of crypto cash was not involved in paying for the privilege of meeting fiat royalty. The funds instead came from BitTorrent, which Tron acquired last year and which has “nothing to do with” the crypto sector, he noted.

Data from Coinatmradar shows that the increase in bitcoin ATM installation across the globe in May 2019 reached a 1-year high. Comparing the number of machines installed and removed during the month shows net positive growth of 228.  Operators installed 306 bitcoin ATMs during the month, bumping up the number of such machines from 4,690 to 4,898. The highest ever net positive growth as recorded by Coinatmradar is still the 256 achieve in April 2018. This significant increase in crypto ATM installation in May 2019 coincides with the market’s best month so far in the year. Bitcoin, in particular, added more than $3,500 to its price in May, increasing by close to 60%. BTC’s stellar performance in May saw its year-to-date growth cross 120 percent. The top-ranked cryptocurrency has since dipped by about 10 percent after reaching a 2019 high of $9,100. According to Coinatmradar, more bitcoin kiosks offered support for other cryptocurrencies in May 2019 than in previous months. In its monthly summary report published on Thursday (June 6, 2019) the platform revealed that 69.6 percent of all machines features support for other tokens apart from BTC.  Ether (ETH) remains the most popular supported cryptocurrency after bitcoin with litecoin and bitcoin cash in second and third, respectively (as far as altcoin support is concerned). More than 150 machines added support for ETH in May 2019. As at press time, there are 4,935 crypto ATMs spread over 77 countries around the world. The United States still has the greatest number of such machines and also saw the highest number of installations in May 2019. The U.K. and Hungary had the second and third highest increase in bitcoin ATM installation for the month. Bahrain also got its first ever bitcoin ATM, currently located in Manama. Amid the continued growth of the crypto ATM market, there appears to be regulatory trouble on the horizon, especially from Canada. The country is second in the world after the United States when it comes to hosting these specialized machines. Now, city officials in Vancouver are reportedly looking to ban bitcoin ATMs. Law enforcement officials in the city say crypto kiosks are being used to for money laundering. The first ever bitcoin ATM in the world was installed in Vancouver back in 2013. Meanwhile, south of the border, Coinstar announced last month that it’s planning to expand bitcoin buying support to over 2,200 location across the U.S. after a successful trial. Though, it should be noted that these aren’t counted in as specialized ‘bitcoin ATMs’ by CoinATMRadar. Do you think the increasing number of bitcoin ATMs will make cryptocurrencies more mainstream?

Male stockings are all the rage. And 2019 is the new 2017, according to Bitcoin millionaire and ‘wunderkind’ Erik Finman. Erik Finman. If that name rings a bell, it’s probably for one of a few reasons. It could be because of his extremely large fortune accumulated by buying bitcoin in 2011. Or, it could be for his equally large ego.  Finman was never backward in coming forward about his riches, staging plenty of gaudy pictures on his Instagram account.   Icons like me 😘💅will always be hated. bc we are the immortals. just wait till what’s next. A post shared by  ERIK FIN (@erikfinman) on Jul 28, 2018 at 11:56am PDT  If that doesn’t jog your memory, it may be because he came out with a woefully wrong prediction last December that Bitcoin was dead and Litecoin was breathing its last breaths. Just a few days later, both markets began to sprint with Litecoin making gains of over 250 percent. If you still haven’t got this now 20-year-old ‘wunderkind’ down, perhaps it’s because you’re using his “revolutionary” new app CoinBits. Although, that’s rather doubtful since a rehash of a four-year-old investment app using dollar-cost averaging is hardly revolutionary and it has just a handful of users. However you’ve heard of the now post-pubescent Bitcoin messiah, he’s rebranding himself and moving away from his tragic predictions of 2018. That was so last year, after all. Finman is switching up the dark glasses and suit for some nerdy specs and a T-shirt and positioning himself as a thought leader in the space, presumably with a very expensive PR agency behind him. It turns out that Bitcoin and blockchain are back in fashion and “cutting edge” after all. While Finman makes soundbite statements like this and enthuses that products like his will ‘resurrect’ the Bitcoin price back to $20k by the end of the year, it’s hard not to roll your eyes. After all, Finman’s knowledge of Bitcoin goes back to 2011. If anyone should know better about the cryptocurrency space, it’s him. And 2019 is definitely not the new 2017. Far from it, in fact; a lot has changed over the last two years. To start with, expectations have been adjusted from the mania days, in which blockchain could cure cancer and geeks with too much money were busy spending their college funds on CryptoKitties. Bitcoin is way better placed than ever it was during the height of retail FOMO. Transactions, hash rate, usage, and average block size are all well up from 2017 despite the long bear market. There’s a ton more fiat on-ramps, proven use cases, more Bitcoin ATMs, fewer scams, institutional investment, major names like Microsoft, eBay, and Apple on board. Even the SEC has decided that Bitcoin is not a security.  So, change your image all you want Mr. Finman. But save us these trite soundbites, particularly after you declared Bitcoin dead. Oh, and, please stop this desperate bid to align yourself with big brand names like Facebook, AT&T, and Andrew Yang–no matter how much your PR agency insists.

The coin, now known as ‘Libra’ (and no longer GlobalCoin as first believed), is expected to launch on 18th June. So what does Long predict? 1/ 6 PREDICTIONS about what @Facebook's #cryptocurrency means. Grab the popcorn bc I analyzed publicly disclosed info to make 6 predictions, of which 2 will be controversial (#2 and #6). @ForbesCrypto #Libra #bitcoin https://t.co/6EI55eyvUA — Caitlin Long 🔑 (@CaitlinLong_) June 9, 2019  Libra will be aggressively marketed in developing nations with more volatile fiat currencies. Long highlights Venezuela as the most visible example, and says: By providing citizens of developing nations with access to a store-of-value that is more reliable than their government-backed currencies, Facebook’s cryptocurrency will indirectly exert fiscal and monetary discipline on developing nations—which will improve the lives of many people globally. Long believes that Facebook will face a backlash from users if it does not share interest income from the assets backing the cryptocurrency. Although most stablecoins ‘pocket the float’, Libra will likely be too big and visible to get away with this. This could also highlight the level of corporate subsidies from the Fed to U.S. banks, leading to calls to repeal them. Facebook plans to hand over control of Libra to an independent foundation, which it formed in Switzerland. This foundation is likely to become powerful in global capital markets, as it will do what central banks do. It will define the relative weighting of the fiat currencies to which Libra is pegged, and manage the assets.  This is a positive thing, as it will highlight how ill-suited existing regulations are to cryptocurrency. Long also ponders: Will Facebook catch breaks from regulators that smaller start-ups haven’t—because of the tax data honeypot Facebook’s project will generate for governments? Either way, it should bring more clarity to the rest of the cryptocurrency space. Facebook plans to apply more stringent forms of KYC and AML than most cryptocurrencies. This would lead to the aforementioned ‘tax data honeypot’, as governments would be very keen to trace every dollar spent by their citizens. Not that Facebook will necessarily agree to provide it. However, not having the greatest track record when it comes to data security, Facebook will be the topic of many discussions now its corporate power will extend to money. Facebook’s cryptocurrency will greatly accelerate interest and education in the sector. However, Long thinks that this is just a welcome detour on the way to increased Bitcoin adoption. Bitcoin is scarce, while Facebook’s cryptocurrency is not. People will migrate over time to the most honest ledger for storing their hard-earned wealth—and that’s not fiat currencies or derivatives thereof, including Facebook’s cryptocurrency. The same happened in Venezuela; when Maduro tried to educate people to support the Petro, they ended up gravitating towards bitcoin. Do you agree with these predictions for Facebook’s crypto?

Data from cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp’s generally more conservative price tracker put BTC/USD at $7720 as of press time Monday.  The pair had had a rocky weekend’s trading, losing around 9 percent since Friday and bottoming out at $7533. 24-hour losses totaled 2.7%, while monthly performance remains stronger at 14.4% gains.  Bitcoin price 00 retracement after hitting $9000 has nonetheless instilled caution in analysts. Tuur Demeester, founding partner at Adamant Capital and a regulator Bitcoin commentator, noted BTC/USD had broken a key trendline last week, having already sounded the alarm about a new downturn.  “Should $9,000 prove the top (which is not a given) and if then we’d see a 2012-style correction repeated, we would expect after an initial crash to see bitcoin trade in a range between $6,800 and $7,680 (27–44% retrace of the rally),” he wrote in a blog post June 5.   For Demeester, a key aspect of this year’s Bitcoin price rally is its similarity to a previous bull cycle in 2012.  This time around, however, increased market maturity is resulting in differing qualities, but “excessive short term optimism” remains a factor.  “In our opinion, and as Peter Brandt argues, for this bull market to continue at a healthier pace we need for the FOMO to subside, which will likely happen via a violent correction,” he concluded.  After that, we could for a few months see bitcoin trade in a range with lows that are 25% below whatever the high this parabolic curve will produce. As Bitcoinist reported, Brandt had himself appeared overly optimistic at the end of May, saying he felt “comfortable” getting exposure to Bitcoin again as the cryptocurrency traded around $8400. John Bollinger meanwhile warned Bitcoin traders to “pay attention” at the beginning of June as uncertainty in markets continued, highlighting the possibility of an up to 50% correction.  Even now, however, not everyone is pessimistic. For the social media trader known as Rhythm, the current wavering simply marks the brooding phase of a parabolic trend, something similar to Bitcoin’s 2017 performance.  “This $BTC parabolic rise is still on-going and has yet to break,” he summarized Monday. Earlier today, Bitconist noted that BTC price has recorded the biggest weekly loss since December 2018. What do you think about the short-term outlook for Bitcoin price?
