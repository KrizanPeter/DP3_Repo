In 2018, a report issued by John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas, showed that the currency was potentially being manipulated by tether during the previous year. Its price spiked the way it did because people who owned tether would repeatedly use that currency to buy bitcoin, thereby pushing its price higher whenever BTC fell by even the slightest margin. This is what tied bitcoin to the U.S. dollar. Later down the line, when bitcoin did finally reach its all-time high, the report alleges that those who had done the purchasing sold their stashes in droves  vast amounts all at once, causing the market to fall as dramatically as it did. Now, there are concerns that the same thing is happening  that the crypto spaces big claim to fame is being twisted and turned behind closed doors. These worries stem from bitcoins sudden drop. The currency was trading for over $10,000 during the first few weeks of September, but then ultimately fell by more than $1,000 into the $8,000 range within just a matter of minutes earlier this week. Whats the reason for such a massive drop from grace? In a new report, Arcanes Bendik Norheim Schei writes: Statistically, it is highly unlikely that the price falls in advance of CME settlement should be caused by mere coincidence. The figures thus support a hypothesis that the bitcoin price is manipulated in advance of CME settlement. However, the figures do not say anything about deliberate manipulation or, for example, only a result of investors strategy hedging. CME is a Chicago-based company that has been offering BTC futures contracts since late 2017. These futures settle in cash, and many believe that traders involved in these contracts may be shorting the bitcoin price  betting low and purchasing assets for well below their worth. Schei says that bitcoin futures contracts can be dangerous when used for this reason. He explains: These futures contracts are optimal for manipulation. They are settled in dollars and not in bitcoin. The price for the settlement is determined by the bitcoin price in the underlying market. Thus, it is never actual bitcoin that changed hands, and it is just an overlying market traded in dollars. The primary focus, as of late, is Bakkt, which went live last Sunday to rather lackluster fanfare. Despite spending a year in the making and being considered one of the prime tools for making bitcoin and crypto legitimate, the platform traded only five bitcoin futures contracts within its first hour of operation. This number rose to a measly 28 within the first ten hours. By the end of the day, only 72 contracts had been traded. Compare this figure to the thousands of contracts traded on CME.

Thats right. The arena of big banks and stock players is working hard to develop ways for bitcoin to avoid volatility. As of late, many reports have emerged stating that the currency is experiencing its lowest volatility in months. That all changed yesterday when it seemingly lost more than $1,000 in value in just a matter of minutes, but prior, the currency was enduring a long-lasting standstill. Nevertheless, it appears the currency is still suffering and vulnerable to price swings, and until this little problem is solved, we can expect bitcoin to remain at the bottom of the financial ladder. It will never become mainstream, it will never be legitimized, and it will never be ready for widespread use. Wall Street is hoping to invoke new businesses, products and strategies designed to assist bitcoin in its journey towards greater stability. One such product was the Bakkt futures contracts platform, released to the public last Sunday. The regulation guiding the platform is designed to bring bitcoin and crypto to a new level, but it hasnt caught on quite yet. Some are nervous about these newly imposed rules backing what are designed to be decentralized assets, which may have contributed to the low-end participation the platform experienced within its first 24 hours. Still, Wayne Chen  the CEO of Interlapse Technologies  says that the introduction of Bakkt is a good thing in that its gotten the ball rolling on later bitcoin-based regulated products. He explains: The launch of a bitcoin futures contract through ICE is a significant advancement for bitcoin futures trading. Bitcoin is deemed as a commodity by regulators and adding it into a futures contract is the right move Bitcoin futures trading has already seen the spotlight in December 2017 through CME. Although trading was settled in cash rather than physical bitcoins at the time, it provided an essence of legitimacy for taking bitcoin mainstream. Ultimately, providing more comfort and assurance to investors. Unfortunately, some analysts believe Wall Streets plays in the bitcoin arena are likely to lead to a bumpy road  one in which instability is much more common at first than stability. Ryan Uhr, CEO and co-founder of Coin Plug, comments: A new opening of a BTC derivative market may have a negative effect on the BTC price in the short term because it gives traders more chances to bet on a price decline. With no markets to provide short-selling opportunities (or something similar), only BTC holders can sell BTC, thereby negatively affecting the market price. Whereas if people can sell BTC futures, they may get benefits when the price moves downward even without holding the underlying BTC. ","['Bakkt', 'bitcoin', 'Wall Street']"

Bitcoin, with virtually no signs whatsoever, lost more than $1,000 in just a matter of minutes, falling from about $9,480 at this time yesterday to roughly $8,110. By the mid-afternoon, the currency had jumped back up to $8,600, but at press time, it has fallen back down to approximately $8,410, so the coin is still meandering through swampy terrain. Of course, bitcoin wasnt alone. The entire crypto scene turned red as every major coin, both large and small, began to bleed out like wounded soldiers on a battlefield. Ethereum, for example, fell more than 15 percent and dropped from about $190 to $157. XRP fell to about 23 cents per unit, and Litecoin would end the day trading in the high $50 range after spending time at $65 earlier in the day. So, what happened? What could make the crypto space fall so dramatically in such a short space? One thing could have been the introduction of Bakkt. Officially launching last Sunday, the platform is designed to give both retailers and institutional players easier access to crypto. Some sources claim that the platforms introduction to investors was strong, but if you look at the stats, one can easily see that Bakkts debut was less than stellar. Within the first hour of Bakkts arrival on the crypto scene, only five futures contracts were traded. Within ten hours, the number only rose to 28. Its clear that institutional players are still worried when it comes to crypto. Thus, Bakkt hasnt had the reception many of us thought it would have. Still, spokesmen for the platform are suggesting that strong participation occurred during Bakkts first official night in business. A statement by one such spokesman reads: On the first day of trading on ICE Futures U.S., there was strong industry participation in Bakkt Bitcoin Futures and the [October 2019] monthly contract had the tightest bid-offer spreads in the market, which was an exciting achievement. As the only end-to-end regulated market for digital assets, Bakkt Bitcoin Futures will play a key role in bringing greater price discovery and risk management to the bitcoin market. Another source suggests that the fall of bitcoin may have something to do with margin calls that occurred at Bitmex, a cryptocurrency exchange based in the nation of Seychelles in Africa. Several long trades seem to have occurred over the past 48 hours, in which customers that held a lot of crypto felt the need to sell to potentially lessen their chances at loss. Large sells like these could have taken the market in a nasty direction. ","['Bakkt', 'bitcoin', 'BitMEX', 'crypto']"

BTC is likely to face a strong resistance near $9,000 and $9,350 if it attempts to recover. This past week, bitcoin price struggled to rise above the $10,300 resistance against the US Dollar. As a result, the BTC/USD pair started a solid decline below the $10,000 support. Furthermore, there was a close below the $10,000 support and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). More importantly, there was a break below a crucial breakout pattern with support near $10,140 on the 4-hours chart. It opened the doors for more downsides below $9,800. This week, the price resumed its decline after a minor upside correction to $10,380. It broke many supports near $9,600 and $9,350 to enter a bearish zone. Moreover, there was a break below the $9,000 and $8,500 supports. A new monthly low was formed near $8,169 and the price is currently consolidating losses. It tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last major decline from the $10,380 high to $8,169 low. On the upside, there are many hurdles near the $8,800 and $9,000 levels. The main resistance is near the $9,300 level. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the last major decline from the $10,380 high to $8,169 low. Moreover, there is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $9,750 on the same chart. Therefore, an upward move towards the $9,000 and $9,300 levels is likely to face a strong selling interest. The current price action suggests more downsides below the $8,500 level. It seems like the price may even break the $8,169 low and the $8,000 handle in the coming sessions.  Looking at the chart, bitcoin price is now trading in a downtrend below $9,000. In the short term, there could be upsides and recovery, but the bulls are likely to struggle near $9,000 and $9,350. Only a daily close above $9,350 might decrease the current selling pressure. 4 hour MACD  The MACD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. 4 hour RSI (Relative Strength Index)  The RSI is currently in the oversold area. Key Support Levels  $8,160 and $8,000. Key Resistance Levels  $8,800, $9,000 and $9,350. ","['bitcoin', 'BTC']"

Bear in mind that people arent necessarily at a point where theyre replacing fiat with cryptocurrency altogether, but bitcoin ATMs are serving a huge purpose for those in countries that lack financial infrastructure. In Latin America, for example, where these products seem to garner most of their business, countries such as Venezuela have been bogged down by socialism for years, leaving many people in the dust. In addition, several citizens within these nations remain unbanked and do not possess access to acceptable forms of credit or similar banking products, i.e. checking or savings accounts. Thus, crypto serves a grand purpose for people like this in that they dont necessarily need stellar financial backgrounds to get their hands on a few digital coins here and there. Plus, many of these countries are dealing with inflation. The bolivar, Venezuelas national form of fiat, has fallen flat on its face in recent years, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum and Dash can open many doors for citizens. According to Brandon Mintz, CEO of Bitcoin Depot  one of the largest providers of crypto-based ATMs in the world  the problems of the unbanked extend to residents of the U.S., which for the most part, is a largely developed region. Nearly ten percent of American citizens are unbanked or underbanked and must rely on alternative means to get the money they need. In certain cases, peer-to-peer platforms do the trick, but bitcoin ATMs also have hidden advantages, and more machines are popping up all over the rural U.S. He states: The physical bitcoin ATMs provide a vital connection between underbanked communities and the crypto world. Were seeing our user numbers rising day by day, usually by those who dont  for one reason or another  trust traditional banking systems, or who complain fees for transferring money internationally are much too high. One big thing were seeing as of late are remittance workers from places like Mexico working across the border and sending money home to their families. Its arguably easier to do this with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, whereas large banking institutions can charge high fees and may require as many as a few days to initiate transfers. Not to mention currency exchanges can reach a whole new level of difficult. With crypto, however, the process is considerably easier given that the transaction only involves one type of currency. Money can also be moved quickly, sometimes within the span of a few minutes depending on the asset involved (i.e. EOS, Ethereum, etc.) Mintz has some big plans for his company, explaining: Our plan is to increase our network to 1,000 ATMs by the end of 2020 to [make] cryptocurrency accessible to everyone.

People will now be able to participate in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stock trades and cryptocurrency transactions through one company. Approximately 40 different coins are available for purchase and trade via So Fi, and customers can trade as much as $50,000 per day. These and other services will now be available to customers situated in 36 different states. Alex Adelman, CEO of the bitcoin rewards app Lolli, says that the move is a milestone in the crypto industry given that more and more people are demanding services related to digital assets. He states: Users not currently demanding it will have easier access because theyre already using these services. Its a big deal for the industry because [users of] these apps that are used by millions of people already as investment tools are going to see bitcoin and other digital assets alongside the stocks and assets they already know Investments feel a little scary to a lot of people and many wouldnt consider themselves investors, so the more touchpoints people have with digital assets that make them feel similar to the things theyre already doing, the simpler it is to get into bitcoin. At press time, So Fi has roughly 800,000 users  a considerably smaller number when compared to the customers of companies like Robinhood and Square  but its name is about to get much bigger. Recently, the company bought the naming rights to the Los Angeles stadium. The edifice will be renamed So Fi Stadium and will host the Super Bowl in 2022. Bill Barhydt, CEO of the cryptocurrency wallet app Abra, believes that So Fi will really make a name for itself outside the U.S., where crypto use is becoming far more mainstream thanks to a lack of financial infrastructure in most third world or developing nations. He also says that crypto investing is becoming far less intimidating given two specific camps he sees emerging from U.S. investors. He comments: Theres the millennial camp, which says this is a great hedge against the dumb stuff governments do to erode my future wealth and investments and that crypto represents a good, long-term opportunity as a hedge against those things. Then, theres the older perspective from baby boomer investor types, who might agree with that, but are just interested in getting outside investment returns. Hes confident that in time, banks will be forced to lose all their inhibitions regarding crypto and blockchain and will have no choice but to jump aboard the digital asset bandwagon.

This marks the first time since August that the currency has fallen below $10,000. It also marks a fall of about $700 in just the last couple days. Bitcoin, as analysts claim, has been experiencing lesser volatility over the past few months, but when movements like this occur, its hard to take these words as pure fact. If that were true, why is bitcoin suddenly experiencing such bearish activity? Yes, the currency is still up from when it reached $5,000 in April nearly six months ago, but the currency has fallen hard over just a 72-hour period. So, what can we expect for the currency in the coming weeks? Will it drop even further or rebound as it usually has? This isnt the first time the currency has dropped down into the mid-$9,000 range this year, and it probably wont be the last. What we are consistently seeing, when falls do occur, is that they repeatedly take bitcoin down to this level, but its not long before it comes back up and surpasses $10,000 again, so in that sense, perhaps bitcoin is experiencing a lack of volatility and traversing through a wide, $700 range. Unfortunately, if one were to look at a site like CoinMarketCap.com and examine the present token offerings, theyd notice that virtually every single cryptocurrency is in the red. The entire market is bleeding out and fighting for its life. Mainstream tokens like Ethereum and Ripples XRP, for example, have fallen by more than eight and six percent respectively over the past 24 hours. Others, such as EOS or Litecoin have fallen by anywhere between nine and 11 percent. The only currency that seems to be doing well is one known as Chain Link, which ironically, Live Bitcoin News reported on yesterday as one of three potential coins that were set to do well over the coming 12 months according to YouTube star Nicholas Merten. One sees this news and cant help but feel that maybe the host of Data Dash, arguably the most popular crypto-related program on the streaming and video site, has a point. Other smaller altcoins ranging from THETA to Mona Coin are also up by anywhere between one and 11 percent, but these are small assets that arent making much of a dent in the industry to begin with. Thus, its very unlikely that their price hauls have anything to do with the stability of the market, nor are they set to do much for the markets improvement. In any case, this is simply a time where enthusiasts will have to wait out the storm. ","['bitcoin', 'Chain Link', 'crypto']"

ICE Launches BTC Futures Contracts,"['Futures Contracts Are All the Rage', 'Theres Still Time to Do Good Things']"," The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), launched its own bitcoin futures contracts for the first time on Sunday. The idea regarding futures contracts and trading physical bitcoins has been intriguing to most, with other companies like Chicagos CME recently saying it will also launch bitcoin futures starting in early 2020. Whats special about ICEs bitcoin futures is that this potentially marks the first move of Bakkt, a trading platform designed to allow institutional traders access to cryptocurrencies. In addition, its also built for retailers who are interested in accepting cryptocurrencies as means of payment. The news was first initiated in a tweet on Sunday night, when bitcoin was trading for just over $10,100. At press time, the price of the asset has fallen somewhat to around $9,900. All users settling contracts will receive bitcoin units upon doing so. ICE contracts are also federally regulated. Many enthusiasts are hopeful that bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry can begin taking valid steps towards legitimacy through moves like this. Marking the start of Bakkt is interesting in that bitcoin has fallen in price over the past 48 hours. Its been suggested by many analysts and experts that enterprises like Bakkt would potentially cause spikes in the bitcoin price, and while its still too early to tell, the latest signs of bitcoins price maneuvers dont look good. Perhaps the problem is that Bakkt, for the most part, is old news. First introduced in late 2018, the platform has been meandering its way through crypto news sites for roughly one year and has encountered delay after delay. Much like the many bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have been submitted, the enterprise has failed to come to fruition within a set period, so while many still anticipate the release of said products, others have lost interest and moved on. This is a shame when one considers just how revolutionary these ventures are for crypto. The idea that institutional traders  individuals and corporations that many believe would legitimize the crypto space  are finally getting full, regulated access to digital currencies and that more businesses are allowing their use as forms of payment is very big, so if this is all we have to look forward to regarding the bitcoin price  a couple of small rises here and there followed by almost instant drops  thats disappointing to say the least. At press time, Bakkt lists companies like Starbucks and Microsoft as investing enterprises. The big claim to fame of futures contracts involving bitcoin is that there are agreements in place to sell these contracts at set prices, meaning that despite the coins volatility, sellers and traders can agree on specific terms beforehand and potentially avoid price swings.

Once again, bitcoin has dropped below the $10,000 mark and is trading for just over $9,800. While this isnt a major fall, the currency seems to have wavered between this mark and $10,200 over the past month. Merten isnt concerned by this. In fact, hes looking to use the situation to his advantage, and advises others to do the same. As the host of YouTubes Data Dash, arguably one of the most popular cryptocurrency channels on the streaming and video site, Merten claims that there are three specific cryptocurrencies that are likely to shoot up now that bitcoin is wavering if people are looking to invest. Those cryptocurrencies are Basic Attention Token (BAT), Raven Coin (RVN), and Chain Link (LINK). In a recent interview, he states that these three tokens are likely to grow heavily over the next 12 months, explaining: At the current moment, looking at [bitcoin] market dominance, it does look like were starting to enter into a trend shift where altcoins can start to gain as we retest back towards bitcoins high of $20,000. The last two [altcoin cycles] that we had were at the end of the overall bitcoin cycle where bitcoin reached $20,000. The first one happened at the beginning of 2017 when bitcoin retested its high at $1,100. For the most part, altcoins have had a relatively rough year in 2019. Bitcoin on the other hand, has experienced steady growth since April, doubling its price since then from $5,000 to about $10,000. While many have focused on bitcoin as of late, Merten says hes starting to see funds travel into smaller, competing coins. He says: As bitcoin does increase over time, as we tend to see a general growth in bitcoins price, we tend to see more risk taking in different types of digital assets. As more liquidity has entered bitcoin, you have the ability now, through exchanges, for that liquidity to exit into other alternative investments. Sometimes, that can be rampant speculation, and in other cases, it can be driven through fundamentals. I believe this time around, in this cycle, were going to see more going toward fundamental developed projects that actually have real demand. Chain Link is big in that its joined software company Oracle to help blockchains connect with outside networks. Raven Coin is significant because it allows developers to establish their own tokens, while BAT is moving forward in that it is attached to the Brave browser, which seeks to block advertisements and trackers from following ones searches and online activity. Merten is confident BAT will be very important in the field of privacy. ","['BAT', 'Chainlink', 'Nicholas Merten', 'RavenCoin']"

Canada has proven to be very attractive to foreign crypto miners, who see the company as a prime haven thanks, in part, to its low energy costs and vast open spaces  perfect for building new mining businesses. At press time, the bitcoin hash rate is breaking all sorts of records, which means that extracting new coins is becoming increasingly difficult. In addition, the topic of bitcoin and crypto mining appears to be setting off a firestorm across the globe. China, for example, once a prime location for bitcoin users, garnered much income in 2017 and 2018 through bitcoin mining companies like Bitmain, centered in Chinas capital of Beijing. The problem is that the country has discussed invoking a permanent ban on cryptocurrency mining in the future thanks to its hazardous environmental impact. Mining new coins, its said, is responsible for several carbon emissions making their way into Earths atmosphere. If China were to invoke such a ban, companies like Bitmain would likely have to find new homes, and China would miss out on several funds it could potentially put towards building its digital economy. The good news, however, is that China has been discussing the ban for many years and has seemingly done little to nothing about it during that time, so the idea of such a move taking place seems a little far-fetched at this point. The A10 machines were launched last March. Their claim to fame is that they consume lesser energy than other standard miners while offering high computational power to operators everywhere. With the number of machines that its now utilizing, Bit Farms mining power will grow to roughly 51 megawatts. Wes Fulford, chief executive officer of Bit Farms, comments in a press release: This past week, our operations team has successfully installed 205 PH/s of new T3 mining hardware in Phase 1 at our Sherbrooke expansion. The new Avalon equipment, combined with 50 PH/s of additional T3s announced last week, will increase Bit Farms computation capacity to 667 peta hash, more than double the hash power reported in the second quarter of 2019. Going forward, our operations team is nearing completion of our Sherbrooke Phase 2 infrastructure in order to facilitate the installation of subsequent new generation hardware deliveries. The bitcoin mining industry has become very competitive as of late, especially in Canada, and companies are looking for new ways to alleviate some of the pressure. Canadian blockchain firm Block Stream, for example, has partnered with Hydro Quebec to ensure that all energy remains affordable to its miners given that the electricity it provides runs on waterpower.

His resignation from Overstock came about in August when it was revealed he had been involved in the investigation of accused Russian spy Maria Butina. In a recent blog post, Byrne comments about his situation and writes: After paying tens of millions in taxes the rest will be in investments that are counter-cyclical to the economy: gold, silver and two flavors of crypto. The rest of the blog is strange, to say the least, and does feel like the words of someone preparing for the battle of their lives. Its unclear what Byrne is trying to get across and he writes: The gold and silver are stored outside of the United States, in Switzerland, and within two weeks, will be scattered in other locations that are even more outside of the reach of the deep state, but are places that are safe for me The crypto is stored in the place where all crypto is stored: in mathematical mist, behind long keys held only in the memory of someone who is quite good at storing such things in memory (with paper backups in the hands of a priest I met 35 years ago who never sets foot in the west). What is he talking about? Sure, Byrne has commented in the past that a massive global apocalypse is coming, but this all sounds a little far-fetched. Storing ones private keys with a priest? Scattering money everywhere in areas only you can find? This sounds like something out of a modern-day Indiana Jones flick. Either that or a major scavenger hunt of some kind At press time, its unclear which two flavors of cryptocurrency hes talking about, though to be fair, one will likely be bitcoin. Byrne has constantly praised the asset, while Overstock.com was one of the first major retailers to accept BTC as a means of payment during a time when cryptocurrency was mostly used for speculation and growing ones wealth. However, Byrnes Medici Ventures has consistently sought to place money in new blockchain ventures.

Tim McCourt, global head of equity index and alternative investment products at CME says: These new products are designed to help institutions and professional traders manage spot market bitcoin exposure, as well as hedge bitcoin futures positions in a regulated exchange environment. In addition, roughly 7,000 bitcoin futures contracts (equal to about 35,000 bitcoin units at the time of writing) have traded each day on CME beginning in 2019. Its easy to get caught up in the hype and hoopla surrounding new products like futures contracts, but two big questions come to mind: how much can they really do for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and how much will people really get into them? At first, ones automatic answer might be a lot, but if one were to look at the facts as of late, theres a lot to consider. Take the notion of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), for example. This product has been in the works for years, but it hasnt gotten very far. In fact, recently VanEck Solid X, a joint venture that first issued their application for a bitcoin ETF in March of 2017, withdrew their latest proposal for one such product despite a quick and upcoming decision date in mid-October. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was set to say yes or no regarding the application in about one month, which means the company was on the verge of getting its decision after 2.5 years of waiting, so to suddenly withdraw the proposal like that is strange and raises a lot of questions, such as, Did VanEck Solid X think nobody would be interested all of a sudden? Who knows, but this is giving other companies, such as Bitwise, a chance to steal the spotlight with their bitcoin ETF applications. Despite the upcoming October decision dates for these companies, SEC chairman Jay Clayton believes it will be a long time before a bitcoin ETF is approved. In addition, VanEck recently released a new bitcoin trust product that would have allowed users to trade baskets of BTC. Despite the gravity of the product, it made very little headway, attracting only $40,000 (roughly four bitcoin units at the time) in trades during its initial weekend launch. And, of course, theres Bakkt, which has encountered delay after delay. Reports have emerged recently discussing what Bakkt, at this stage, could really do for bitcoin should it suddenly move forward.

The purpose of the document is to suggest why the world is ready for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). For the most part, this is nothing new. Van Eck Solid X ultimately forwarded a similar statement to the SEC earlier this year, only to withdraw its ETF proposal at the last minute. This withdrawal took place a few days ago when a final decision regarding the ETF was slated for mid-October. At press time, no reason for the withdrawal has been given, and many traders and analysts are left heavily confused by the situation. This was a company that had been pushing for a bitcoin ETF since March of 2017, so it is odd to see the company throw in the towel like that after everything it went through to garner notice and approval. At the same time, the situation has given Bitwise an opportunity to hog the spotlight. Now that Van Eck and Solid X are out of the picture Bitwise can potentially jump in and hit all the right notes with the SEC so that its own bitcoin ETF application gets attention from the right people. The companys global head of research Matt Hougan explains in a statement: The reality is that the bitcoin market of today bears little resemblance to the crypto market of a few years ago. The crypto market today is one dominated by firms like Jane Street and Fidelity. Its one where a regulated, institutional custodian can provide world-class services and is insured by Lloyds of London. In the document, the argument for a bitcoin ETF has three main points:     The bitcoin spot market has become efficient.     Bitcoin custody has become fully institutional.     The regulated futures market has become significant. Sadly, SEC chairman Jay Clayton is expressing doubts that a bitcoin ETF would make its way to the front financial pillar anytime soon. In fact, today, during New Yorks Alpha Conference, Clayton spoke ill of the prospects of bitcoin, claiming that: If [investors] think theres the same rigor around that price discovery as there is on the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange they are sorely mistaken. We have to get to a place where we can be confident that trading is better regulated. The document submitted by Bitwise has been posted for public comment. Officially known as the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust, should the proposal meet all the requirements and garner approval from the SEC, it would trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The SEC will make its decision regarding the application no later than October 14. ","['Bitcoin ETF', 'Bitwise', 'SEC']"

The currency has gone through some very strange behavior over the past 24 hours, falling below the $10,000 range to $9,600, only to jump back up again and reach the spot where it stood before. Perhaps the remark that the currency is at its lowest volatility levels since last May has some truth to it, or maybe it has something to do with Bakkt. One of the big questions running through investors and analysts minds is whether Bakkt will potentially bring BTC into mainstream territory. The trading platform was announced roughly one year ago in September of 2018 as a means of allowing retailers to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. In addition, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) explained that there would also be an institutional side to Bakkt that would allow professional traders to get involved in crypto trading. Unfortunately, the enterprise has experienced a wide number of delays and setbacks. Originally, Bakkt was set to begin its trading journey in December of last year. Naturally, this didnt happen thanks to the shutdown of the United States government in both that month and the following January. During that time, hype surrounding Facebooks new Libra coin began to steal the spotlight, while Bakkt wound up on the backburner. However, the trading platform has since knocked its latest trading hurdle out of the way, having been cleared for duty with the New York State Department of Financial Services. CEO Kelly Loeffler explains that she and her team are ready to do all thats necessary in pushing bitcoin towards becoming a solid investment tool for both retail and institutional players. She comments: The funds that trade on our exchange expressed to us that they dont want to deal in todays unregulated markets, and want end-to-end federal oversight, on the level of the NYSE, to feel safe trading in bitcoin Pension funds, for example, are diversifying into alternatives. Regulated bitcoin futures could be part of their investment mandate, since they have different correlations with both stocks and bonds, and other alternatives such as gold. One of the big benefits of accepting crypto as a means of payment is that retail companies can avoid the heavy fees that credit card companies tend to charge them whenever customers use plastic. This will ultimately help these companies save each year, and the venture is presently in talks with several heavy players in the retail market about extending its services to them, though these players are not named at press time. ICE founder and CEO Jeff Sprecher says that asset managers are not necessarily needy of bitcoin yet, but theyre intensely curious. He comments: Its the sense that money managers want to be at the front of this train and not left out. ","['Bakkt', 'bitcoin', 'Institutional Traders', 'retail players']"

The program is doing quite well, having garnered more than $29,000 in income and more than 200,000 downloads last August alone, but McCormack says that his journey towards success has been a rough one. In a recent interview, McCormack says what his job schedule typically requires: I work like 80 hours a week. Ive flown all around the world, Ive spent a lot of money and time on doing this. Also, Ive done a lot of work in the background, like studying interview crafting and different ways to construct an interview and the interview art. At press time, the show has produced 150 separate episodes, a trailblazing mark in the world of podcasting, as well as crypto, but things didnt always start out this way. Prior, McCormack worked in advertising and tried to start his own business in that field. Sadly, a bitter divorce got in the way of success. The event caused him to spiral downward into a fit of depression, which ultimately led to drugs and alcohol addiction and the eventual closing of his business. Later in life, upon cleaning up his act, McCormack discovered that his mother was suffering from cancer. Trying to get her access to medical marijuana, McCormack learned about bitcoin  and how it could be used to pay for cannabis supplements. The rest is history, with the podcaster learning all his could about crypto and being ultimately intrigued by its respective properties. This led to the creation of What Bitcoin Did, now one of the most popular crypto-related broadcasts available. McCormack says that if youre going to create a successful podcast, you need to find a truly unique approach. He states: If youre just going to do the same set of interviews everyone else has done, youre going to struggle to steal market shares. One thing that makes his show different is that he travels to visit his interview subjects in person and does the interviews on location. He also says its important to build a brand and decide on which interview approaches to use: Just asking questions doesnt make you an interviewer. I have spent a lot of time learning what my style of interview is and keeping it to that. In the end, however, he says the biggest maneuver for a successful podcast is to simply jump in, record a show and then post it. He says that many people have ideas for podcasts that they never act on, and simply moving forward and taking those first steps towards its creation are arguably the biggest things one can do. He concludes with: Produce a good product and market it very well. ","['bitcoin', 'cryptocurrency podcasts', 'Peter McCormack']"

Without regulation, BTC, in his mind, will never achieve the mainstream status it so desperately longs for. At press time, bitcoins primary attempt to become legit has suddenly dissipated, with CBOE, VanEck and Solid X withdrawing their bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from the SEC about a month before a final decision was set to be made. While a reason for the withdrawal has not been disclosed, the move seems to have had a serious (and negative) effect on bitcoin, with the currency now trading again below $10,000 for the first time in weeks. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading for about $9,881. So much for the currency experiencing its lowest levels of volatility since May Price swings are still a major concern surrounding bitcoin and other forms of crypto, which is why so many institutional and professional traders have been reluctant to move forward with digital assets. Clayton comments: If [investors] think theres the same rigor around the price discovery as there is on the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange They are sorely mistaken. We have to get to a place where we can be confident that trading is better regulated. Crypto was a hot topic at this years Delivering Alpha convention, but the closest bitcoins ever gotten to being listed on a public exchange is through CME futures trading. Sadly, major exchanges are still out of the question for bitcoin, which doesnt possess the legislative backing to move forward. Claytons most recent venture includes trying to provide retail investors with stronger access to public markets. He says hed also like to see private companies launching initial public offerings (IPOs) early and with more doors open for those seeking to take part. He says: If the growth opportunities have shifted not all the way but to a substantial extent into our private markets and ordinary investors dont have access to them, thats not good. The question is, what do we do about it? Whiles hes suggesting a kind of funds structure to potentially ease the situation, he hasnt provided any details regarding what he means or what kind of plan could get the job done. This is relatively the same situation as every other regulator who seeks to stick their fingers into the crypto pot. Theres always a desire for more regulation, but nobody seems capable of implementing it. Several U.S. and international lawmakers, for example, have expressed anger or concern over Facebooks Libra, yet nobody has implemented any sort of rule or statute preventing it from getting any bigger.

If you had high hopes for the possibility of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) finally getting approved this October, you can douse those hopes in gasoline and set them on fire. Why? Not because the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided against it, not because of any delays, but because the instigators of the ETF proposal  CBOE, VanEck and Solid X  are withdrawing it on their own terms. What happened? Seriously, these companies have been trying to get this ETF approved since March of 2017, and now, right as were at the end and the SEC is ready to issue a final decision the following month, it just gets yanked out from underneath? How and why does that work? Those of us really searching for answers havent gotten them yet. Neither of the mentioned companies have issued statements explaining the reason for the withdrawal. Its unclear if the decision has anything to do with VanEcks recent addition of a bitcoin trust to the cryptocurrency market. Known as 144A, the product was ETF-like in nature, but only traded a basket of about four bitcoins (worth roughly $40,000 at press time) and failed to make much of a dent in the behavior of BTC traders. Maybe the company thinks that the unenthusiastic response to its trust will be mirrored should its ETF be approved and introduced for public trading. Either way, VanEck seems to have lost its nerve suddenly, which is a shame considering how much time and energy has been given to the project. On September 4, the head of ETF products at VanEck Ed Lopez commented that the company was still looking to pursue exchange-traded products in the future, stating: We still strongly believe the marketplace and many investors would be better served to have a regulated product out there and this is just one small step towards that and right now it happens to be only available to institutions. This is the second time the company withdrew its application. The first was in early January when the United States was experiencing a prolonged government shutdown. These circumstances threatened an automatic shutdown of the proposal. Two other bitcoin-based ETF proposals are currently in the SECs hands. The first is from Wilshire Phoenix, while the second stems from Bitwise Asset Management. Both are set to be approved or rejected sometime next month. VanEck director of digital asset strategies Gabor Gurbacs has since taken to Twitter to calm digital traders nerves. He writes: We are committed to supporting bitcoin and bitcoin-focused financial innovation. Bringing to market a physical, liquid and insured ETF remains a top priority. We continue to work closely with regulators and market participants to get one step closer every day. ","['Bitcoin ETF', 'Bitcoin Trust', 'SEC', 'VanEck']"

BTC is likely setting up for the next crucial break in the near term. Recently, bitcoin price failed to climb above the $10,500 resistance against the US Dollar. As a result, the BTC/USD pair started a slow and steady decline below the $10,400 support. Moreover, there was a break below the $10,350 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). It opened the doors for more downsides below $10,200. Earlier, the price spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last key leg from the $9,331 low to $10,950 swing high. However, the price remained well bid near the $9,900 and $9,880 levels. Additionally, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last key leg from the $9,331 low to $10,950 swing high also acted as a support. At the moment, the price is trading in a contracting range near the $10,200 level. More importantly, there is a crucial breakout pattern forming with resistance near $10,320 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. If bitcoin price breaks the $10,320 resistance area, there could be a decent upward move. The next key resistance is near the $10,500 level. Any further upsides could push the price towards the $11,000 resistance zone. On the downside, the breakdown support is near the $10,150 level. If there is a close below $10,150, the price could accelerate its decline. The next major support is near $9,880, below which there are chances of a drop towards the $9,550 level. An intermediate support is near the $9,710 level. It represents the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last key leg from the $9,331 low to $10,950 swing high.  Looking at the chart, bitcoin price is clearly setting up for the next crucial break either above $10,320 or below $10,150. The current price action is choppy, but there are very less chances of a strong upward move above $10,400 in the short term. 4 hour MACD  The MACD is slowly losing momentum in the bearish zone. 4 hour RSI (Relative Strength Index)  The RSI is currently well below the 50 level.

In fact, the currency has barely swung at all over the past 1-2 weeks and has largely remained between $10,100 and $10,300. This is because the currency has reached its lowest level of volatility since May of this year. This is a bit of a downer given that the currency isnt spiking the way it was last April through July, but its also somewhat of a blessing. Those of us truly familiar with bitcoin know that when the currency falls, it tends to fall big, and wealth is expunged quickly and without mercy. In 2017, the currency rose to nearly $20,000 per unit. To this day, its still the highest recorded price for bitcoin. However, in 2018, the currency began to drop every month until it had reached the $6,000 range in June of that year. Sadly, even this wasnt meant to last. By Thanksgiving, the currency had lost half of that value, and fallen into the mid-$3,000 range, where it remained until April of this year and once again began experiencing bullish behavior that brought it back into more prominent territory. Several analysts have weighed in on the possible reasons behind the lagging volatility. Tim Enneking, the managing director of Digital Capital Management, believes that hype around bitcoin and its crypto counterparts is dying, and it isnt being viewed through the same high-scope lens that it was before. He comments: Volatility is some of the lowest weve seen in a long time. Clearly, BTC is consolidating. Interestingly, it has been consolidating recently in the upper half of the ever-narrowing pennant its been stuck in since the early June 2019 peak. This is the first time thats happened in over three months. Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager Bit Bull Capital, comments that while volatility might be down now, hes confident bitcoin will spike again in the coming weeks given that were right around the corner from Bakkts launch. He states: Generally, bitcoin is still consolidating. We are now seeing tighter spreads, such as this weekends range between $10,175 and $10,435. Investors are still in a wait-and-see mode, although we expect this to change around events, and the volatility to increase as those events take effect. This Friday is Bakkts physically-custodied bitcoin futures launch, and many investors are watching their adoption by institutions closely. He adds that while an exchange-traded fund (ETF) would likely cause some real positive waves throughout the industry, he doesnt expect the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to rule in its favor next October. Still, hes confident the next bitcoin halving  set for May of 2020  is likely to send bitcoin hurtling towards the sky. ","['Bakkt', 'bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'volatility']"

This is to be expected from someone whos been involved in traditional finance for most of his professional life. Having started the company in the mid-1980s, Blackstone has become one of the most successful trading platforms in the western hemisphere, managing over half-a-billion in assorted customer assets. For the most part, Blackstone has made a name for itself by investing in alternative means of wealth, yet Schwarzman had a few harsh things to say about crypto during his latest interview. He fully admits that he doesnt always understand them, and thus hes a little wary to get involved unless he knows more. He states: I dont have much interest in [crypto] because its hard for me to understand. I was raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies. Theres a reason to want to control currencies, which is why governments all do it. Theres no one who says, I dont care. Part of that is to make sure the economy is as insulated as it can be from excesses. Another part of it is to control bad behavior, so the idea that you can transact without anybody knowing anything, you could have a lot of criminal behavior  dirty money, drug money  running all over the world. It only encourages that kind of activity. Schwarzmans position is understandable, but hes also presenting a lot of old ideas in his argument. For one thing, bitcoin is losing its popular status among criminals given the fact that its not as anonymous as originally presumed. All transactions are recorded to the blockchain, which means that even though the names of the traders may not be available at first sight, the transactions can be tracked between addresses with general ease. At the same time, Schwarzman  while making it clear that hell never own any bitcoin in the coming future  did comment that hes interested in blockchain technology, which he thinks has the power to revolutionize several different industries. He says: I may be a limited thinker, but thats a problem. If [crypto] cold solve that problem and the problem of controlling the money supply, then it might be okay. That doesnt mean that the blockchain technology applied to non-tradeable currencies is not a good thing. That is clearly a good thing There are all kinds of uses you can have from certain executions. [Blockchain] is a very good idea, and it will end up being adopted because its good technology. Applying it to the creation of money is sort of, for my taste, odd.

His most recent price prediction says that bitcoin will reach $250,000 per unit by the time 2023 rolls along. However, in Drapers own words, this prediction is relatively conservative. He comments that several of his previous predictions have followed through with ease, and now hes beginning to think $250,000 over the next four years might be an understatement, and theres a good chance bitcoin could even strike a higher chord. He states: $250,000 means that bitcoin would then have about a five percent market share of the currency world and I think that may be understating the power of bitcoin. As it becomes easier for people to use theyre going to make the decision that they like bitcoin better than any fiat because they know that their fiat will depreciate. It is estimated that the bitcoins he purchased from the auction are worth more than $300 million today. In addition, he has consistently pushed bitcoin as the future of finance, and now it appears many are rushing to his side. Despite his conservative label, his future price prediction is larger than what many other analysts claim will happen. Nigel Green, the CEO of the financial consultancy firm DeVere Group, believes that if bitcoin spikes in the future it wont be because of adoption rates or use cases. Rather, he thinks the U.S. Federal Reserve will probably be at the heart of bitcoins meteoric rise. The government is expected to cut rates this week for the first time in several years. He comments: Bitcoin is likely to break out of its recent sideways trading pattern and be given a healthy boost by the Feds rate cut. This is because an interest rate cut reduces the incentive to keep the fiat currency. In addition, rate cuts typically lead to higher inflation, which reduces the purchasing power of traditional currencies, therefore making cryptocurrencies more attractive. Green has frequently touted the economic weakness stirred by the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, saying that many will likely see bitcoin as a digital gold in that it has the power to sustain wealth and ones net worth during times of strife. Unfortunately, bitcoin hasnt done particularly well during this time, leading many to question just how big an impact the trade war has had on cryptocurrency prices. Still, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, is  like Green and Draper  also confident that bitcoin will spike, though he believes it has more to do with increased hash rates for miners.

The purpose of the funding round was to build a non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange atop the ever-popular Lightning Network, which seems to be growing in popularity as of late. Bitcoin is the oldest and most established cryptocurrency in the world, but this comes with a few disadvantages, the first one being its speed. Given its age, bitcoins technology suffers in terms of its transaction times, which typically require a few days to complete. Compare this with the transaction capabilities of blockchains like Ethereum and EOS, which both utilize smart contracts to complete transactions within the scope of a few hours or a few minutes. Bitcoin may have given birth to the crypto industry, but in some areas, theres a lot to be desired, which is where the Lightning Network appears to be gaining momentum. The platform touts its own quickness and claims it can boost the rapidity of bitcoin payment speeds tenfold. The problem, however, is that the Lightning Network is still not a mainstream application, and few businesses have integrated it into their infrastructures. Thats where enterprises like Spark Swap come in. In a recent interview, Trey Griffith, the founder of the company, explains: Weve long wanted to support BTC and USD as a trading pair since its the most important and popular trading pair. We decided to build it the way we did in order to make it accessible to a much larger group of people who currently lack a convenient option for buying bitcoin without giving up custody. All a person needs to do is download the companys desktop app and connect it to an LND Lightning Network node. They must complete the companys identity verification process and transfer USD funds into their account. Once this is done, the customers can initiate trades and receive bitcoins in exchange for their dollars. Brett Gibson, a partner at Initialized Capital, states: This product delivers on the promise of bitcoin as a self-sovereign currency while still delivering a convenient user experience by building on the Lightning Network. According to one source, use of the Lightning Network has been growing heavily over the past month, with nodes and payment channels on the rise. One of the big benefits of the Lightning Network, other than its speed, is the fact that it can handle a wide range of payments, from very small to very large. These payments settle instantly on the network and allows Bitcoin to scale as many as several million payments each day. Thus far, nearly 10,000 Lightning Network nodes are already in play.

This has caused some to label Roger Ver a genius, while others claim he is traitor to turn his back on the currency that gave birth to the crypto industry in the first place. The switch has also led Ver to duke it out with other industry officials, such as Craig Wright, an Australian bitcoin developer and entrepreneur. Bitcoin cash underwent a serious hard fork in 2018 that many say is to blame for bitcoins sudden fall into the $3,000 range just a few months later. The fork was considered very controversial at the time, with people like Ver saying the new version of bitcoin cash was a terrible mistake, and Wright claiming it was the best version of bitcoin yet. Known as bitcoin SV, the new currency which stems from that hard fork has pitted many of the best against each other in the financial ring. The phone with the wallet built into it is known as Exodus 1. First introduced in May of this year, HTC claims it is among the most-simple crypto-based smartphones to use, while Bitcoin.com executives have expressed excitement that the wallet will bring more customers to its already staggering four million-person user base. Phil Chen, the decentralized chief officer at HTC, explains in an interview that: The Exodus vision has always aligned itself toward public blockchains and its fundamental transformative nature of the future of money and the internet. The Zion Vault is happy to support BCH natively in hardware for security to go hand in hand with the BCH blockchain as an alternative to dominant payment rails and platforms. Another gift is in store for BCH users. Those seeking to pay for their phones with bitcoin cash can expect to receive a special discount granted they make the purchase through the official bitcoin.com store. Roger Ver reveals in a statement: The partnership between Bitcoin.com and HTC will enable bitcoin cash to be used as peer-to-peer electronic cash for all the Exodus users around the world.

While not necessarily bored by it, they are tired of hearing the same things over and over, one of which is that the currency is about to enter a huge rally of sorts. Tom Lee, as reported by Live Bitcoin News earlier today, is back in the limelight again, commenting that the currency is about to hit a new all-time high once the S&P jumps up. Lee, despite claiming that he would never try to predict the bitcoin price again, has come out a few times this year to discuss where it could wind up, even stating the bitcoin could potentially strike the $40,000 mark in 2020. This is a big prediction, but hes not alone in the playing field. Others, such as venture capitalist Tim Draper, have commented that one unit of bitcoin could hit the six-figure range by 2022, spiking to as much as $250,000 each. He later revamped this statement to say that the currency would hit this mark six months later, so a bit of a delay is at hand, but not much. This is all fine and dandy and likely to get some people breaking out the champagne, but for the rest of us, were getting a little tired of just hearing these predictions regarding where it will go later. We want to see change now and given how often everyone talks about the potentially bull rallies that the coin will soon allegedly enter, we cant help but feel a little disappointed with the present results. Everything takes time; were not children, and we understand this. In addition, bitcoin has shown major improvements this year considering how in the trash it was by the time 2018 said goodbye. At that stage, the currency was trading in the mid-$3,000 range and had lost more than 70 percent of its overall value. Many of us thought recovery was completely out of the question, but five months later, it did begin to show signs of life once again, spiking to $5,000 per unit by the time April 2019 rolled along. Since then, its more than doubled in price, but for the most part, its underperformed as of late, especially given the situation involving the trade war. While BTC did spike at certain points during the early moments of the trade conflict, these spikes didnt last long, and many times the currency has dropped to new lows in the $9,000 range. Everyone seems to have an opinion regarding where it will go and what will happen, and some are claiming good things will happen very soon, but at this stage, were tired of just hearing about it. We just want to see it happen already. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Tim Draper', 'Tom Lee', 'trade war']"

Known as B Is for Bitcoin, the book shows children the basics of both the alphabet and cryptocurrency, a technology that is likely to become the norm when theyre full-fledged adults. At press time, cryptocurrency and blockchain can still be considered emerging technologies. While bitcoin is already ten years old, it doesnt have the history of Americas banking system, which emerged during the earliest days of the country through the work of men like Alexander Hamilton. In addition, BTC and its altcoin cousins are still being used primarily for speculative purposes. Compare that to credit cards or cash, which are the primary tools for everyday purposes. However, its probably safe to say that blockchain will become a regular form of technology by the time todays kids have grown up. A technology that will have somehow integrated itself into every business or industry, whether it be shipping, finance, and even entertainment. Author Graeme Moore realized this and wanted to give children an opportunity to understand the technology and money that would likely be far more mainstream by the time theyre in their 20s and 30s. There was just one issue. According to Moore, children dont buy books; their parents do, and he needed to find an intelligent way of marketing the book to adults who would, in turn, read the book to their kids. Describing the process of writing and marketing the story, Moore explains: Their parents buy books, especially if youre writing an ABC book. When the book Go the [Expletive] to Sleep came out, youre selling a book to the two-year olds parents. My book is really targeted at me in five to ten years. Flash forward and I have a kid, what would I buy? I would have purchased [B is for Bitcoin] because its what I want to read to my kid. You know, I dont want to teach my kid, A is for apple and B is for ball. I want to teach him, A is for altcoin, busts and booms. B is for bitcoin, when moon? One can only assume what that last sentence means. Also, busts and booms start with B, not A, but we can probably get the picture of what Moore is trying to do. In fact, he initially started writing the book not for money, but simply because he had a one-and-a-half-year-old niece that he was looking to keep busy. He comments: I was thinking, What would I want to read to her? I dont want to talk about apples and boast and all that kind of stuff. I want to talk about bitcoin to my niece who is about to learn how to talk. The book is now available on Amazon. ","['bitcoin', 'cyptocurrency', 'Graeme Moore']"

The year is almost over  we only have about 3.5 months to go before 2020 rings in  and bitcoin has ultimately underperformed and come up short regarding bitcoin bulls expectations. Lee, naturally, is claiming that BTC is about to enter a rally. So, is he right or wrong? In an interview with CNBC, Lee comments that the S&P is likely to shoot up by more than 3,000 points by the end of the year, and once this happens, bitcoin will follow suit and become a far less risky asset. He states: Bitcoin has kind of stalled recently because the macro outlook has stalled. I think in a world without trend, bitcoin doesnt go up. The next big catalyst, I think, is a decisive breakout in the equity markets because I think once equities break to an all-time high, bitcoin becomes a risk-on asset If markets make a new all-time high and we see central banks still supportive, its kind of good for liquidity, so theres liquidity going into bitcoin. More importantly, if theres an interest in acquiring some volatility, thats where youre going to see people buying bitcoin. Lee has made a consistent name for himself in the crypto market. As a senior analyst at Fundstrat, Lee is always in the background predicting where bitcoin will go, but he hasnt always been correct. At the end of 2018, when bitcoin was on the verge of dropping by more than 70 percent from its all-time high of nearly $20,000 in 2017, Lee consistently explained that the price was about to spike to that level once again It never happened. In fact, bitcoin fell to a new low and sunk to the mid-$3,000 range  the exact opposite of what he had been predicting for nearly a year at that stage. He later explained that he and his company would no longer be making price predictions for bitcoin, stating that they would only be examining trends to see where it would go. This didnt last long, however, as earlier in the year, he went so far as to predict that BTC would reach the $40,000 mark by 2020. Its important to take things like this with a grain of salt and assume that not everything men like Lee say is true. At the same time, hes very bullish about the S&P, and is confident it can push BTC to new heights. He states: Bitcoin does best when the S&Ps up more than 15 percent. Bitcoin may be ambidextrous [in] that it works well in a risk-on world, but as you start to get nervous, then you treat it like digital gold. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Fundstrat', 'Tom Lee']"

Earlier this morning, we reported on a new way to turn bitcoin into cash via the dark web, and now, were here to discuss a new QR code system that sends people to scam sites. For as long as bitcoin and cryptocurrency have existed, there have been malicious actors out there seeking to take what isnt theirs. Unfortunately, the security of the crypto world has often left a lot to be desired, and too many doors remain open for hackers to enter. Among the most common ways to steal ones digital funds include crypto jacking, SIM-swapping and phony initial coin offerings (ICOs), though the latter has seemingly become a thing of the past. Very few companies are looking to employ these fundraising events given the scrutiny theyre likely to face from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if the assets being provided are not registered correctly. There are simply too many unanswered (and confusing) questions. Crypto jacking involves gaining control of a persons computer to mine cryptocurrencies, while SIM-swapping often involves bribing cell provider employees for the private data of account holders. This can include birthdates, social security numbers, and even usernames and passwords. Researchers have conducted a new study through Google, in which they performed searches regarding the generation of bitcoin QR codes to develop new wallet addresses. They say that four of the first five results ultimately led them to scam sites involving codes that if downloaded, could potentially open the door for hackers to steal users funds. One of the researchers explains: These sites generate a QR code that encodes an address controlled by the scammers instead of the one requested by the user, thus directing all payments for this QR code to the scammers. Scammers do not even bother with generating their fake QR themselves. Instead, they shamelessly call a blockchain explorer API to generate the QR for their address. It is estimated that more than $20,000 in crypto funds have been lost to these phony QR codes. The researcher goes on to say: [As QR] codes are not humanly readable, it opens an avenue for fraud. Fraud can be on the receiver side when generating as shown here, but also on the sender side if the sender is using a rogue wallet or even a good wallet using a rogue QR implementation. Cases of thievery in the crypto space have increased exponentially over just the last year alone, with nearly $5 billion in funds being stolen in just the first six months of 2019. This is considerably higher than the $1.7 billion lost or stolen in all of 2018. ","['bitcoin', 'fraud', 'QR Code']"

Several English and Russian dark markets are claiming that users can pay as little as $800 in BTC funds and receive $10,000 USD. The data comes from a new report issued by security-as-a-service provider Armor and its threat resistance unit (TRU). The company analyzes present dark market trends and compiles them all into an annual document explaining which trends are most prominent, and what users should potentially be wary of. The dark web has become a national symbol of evil for those who seek to bring the crypto world deeper into mainstream territory. The light web sees crypto being used for legit purposes, i.e. payments on everyday items and a bit of speculation along the way (nobody said investing was a bad thing). Unfortunately, ventures like the Silk Road allegedly brought about by online engineer Ross Ulbricht  now serving a life sentence  gets in the way of these goals. So long as crypto is consistently tied to black market trends, it can never move beyond its present position. The U.S. Treasury Department just announced that it will work with governments around the world, for example, to ensure crypto doesnt become the next major tool used in terrorist funding. With this new BTC to cash transfer method, one is probably wondering, Why would a hacker or dark market individual seek to exchange so much for so little? How does offering $800 in digital currency garner one so much cash (as much as $10,000)? Chris Hinkley, Head of Armors TRU team, explains the intrigue: For those scammers who dont possess the technical skills and a robust money mule network to monetize online bank account or credit card credentials, this is an offer that can be very attractive. The threat actors are still selling financial account and credit card credentials outright, but this clever service gives them an additional channel for monetizing the large amounts of financial data available on the underground. From what Hinkley suggests, the money the hacker will receive is a small reward compared with the credit card and other private financial data theyll receive regarding the person engaged in the trade. They can take this data and sell it to other dark web users for a profit. All the while, the trader probably thinks they made a solid $9,200 with the trade, yet theyve given up so much more. The process works by paying a set BTC fee. One then receives the money either via PayPal, a direct bank account transfer or a wire through Western Union. Another section of the report explains that hackers are also selling individual proprietorship and LLC registration papers on the dark web for anyone seeking to create false businesses.

That product has already made serious headway in the crypto community. The product is a fund designed to allow institutional investors to make their mark in the world of crypto trading. Its an over-the-counter product which began trading on a platform regulated by the SEC. While very similar with an ETF, it falls into a different category given that its not situated on a national crypto exchange. Jan Van Eck, CEO of Van Eck Associates, comments: The big [cryptocurrency] exchanges are completely unregulated, and the traditional world has sort of said, I dont want to look at this. Im not going to touch it, even though Coinbase has 20 [million] to 30 million client accounts. So, these two worlds are completely separated, and were trying to do a little bit of an overlap ourselves and well see if it works. The path towards a bitcoin ETF has been a long and unfulfilling one as of late. When it comes to VanEck Solid X, the joint venture has tried three times over the span of two years to get an ETF approved. That journey began in March 2017, but the SEC was quick to reject the proposal. After two more tries, the company finally managed to get the agencys attention, who claimed it would look deeper into the matter. It posted the proposal for public comment, and after it garnered many positive responses, the SEC allegedly began to believe that a bitcoin ETF would be quite popular. However, despite several claims that it would make a final decision, the SEC has regularly delayed its potential choices regarding the ETF. A final date has been set for October in which the SEC will say yay or nay once and for all. This new product, known as the VanEck Solid X Bitcoin Trust 144A Shares, has already garnered more than $40,000 in initial investments since it was first announced. Despite this good news, however, the product appears only available to institutional players. Van Eck states: Were not directly or indirectly trying to sell to retail [investors]. Thats not what this game is. Any individual, no matter how rich, cant buy it. It must be an institution. It must be a corporation [or] a bank, but a hedge fund can buy it, a mutual fund can buy it, and an ETF can buy it. ","['Bitcoin ETF', 'SEC', 'VanEck SolidX']"

You either have what it takes to keep going and start more enterprises, or youre a one-hit wonder (or not a hit at all). In the case of Bobby Lee, crypto entrepreneurism appears to be what hes destined to do. Lee is famous for having created Chinas first bitcoin exchange. China has had a very mixed relationship with cryptocurrencies, having banned foreign exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the past. It is also looking into potentially banning crypto mining given its alleged environmental impacts, though the country has yet to move forward on this. At the same time, China says it is ready to unveil its new national cryptocurrency system designed to alleviate competition from the likes of Libra, Facebooks new digital payment coin. Lee ultimately sold his exchange BTCC for an undisclosed sum last year. While it was a huge deal when it first began, the company was forced to cease all operations in 2017 following Beijings decision to ban all crypto-related activity. While an exact number has never been given, Lee claims that the money he earned from the sale of BTCC was in the eight-figure range. Thats a lot of money for a non-functioning exchange. Nevertheless, Lee has used the money to enjoy life, taking vacations and spending time with his family. He comments: I spent most of last year giving speeches, traveling, taking some vacation, spending time with family, just enjoying life having made some money from my last startup. But this easy-going lifestyle didnt last. Apparently, Lee felt that itch to return to the crypto market and show off what he could do once more. He has now unveiled a new startup, known as Ballet, that builds credit-card sized bitcoin wallets. He claims the goal is to grant normal people, regular people access to cryptocurrency. The first product Ballet is releasing is wallet called REAL. Unlike other digital wallets, this product has no electric parts. Thus, while it does contain electronic keys, it cannot be hacked by malicious actors. The wallet stores the private keys that unlock the wallet physically, much like a safe or vault of sorts. Lee states: Its like cash. Once you load it with bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum or whatever, this device has everything it needs to access the funds. It can be used as a gift to give someone or you can just store it in a safe deposit box and hide it somewhere at home. This is completely offline; theres no hacking risk. Ballet is stationed in Las Vegas, Nevada and has already garnered more than $5 million in seed funding since stepping onto the crypto scene. ","['Ballet', 'bitcoin wallet', 'Bobby Lee', 'BTCC']"

Iran has been heavily into cryptocurrency following new economic sanctions from the United States and President Donald Trump pulling his country out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran has sought ways to alleviate some of the issues stemming from these sanctions including potentially introducing a national cryptocurrency that would lessen inflation. Of those who were monitored in the survey, ultimately 35 percent were miners and garnered profits by extracting new coins and tokens. The rest earned money through trading, either with individuals like themselves or through exchanges. The survey also suggests that about 70 percent of the countrys population is interested in cryptocurrency and learning more about the mining process. Jimmy Song, a bitcoin developer and educator, explained in an interview that this kind of behavior is growing more common among third world or developing nations. The economic strife being faced by these states is becoming too heavy to be handled by standard institutional developments or institutions, and the power of crypto is looking stronger in the eyes of everyday citizens. He states: In China, there are WeChat groups [for traders] because they dont have as much direct access to exchanges. Im also hearing about a price premium in Argentina, for example, because the economy is facing some issues What we want for all these places, whether distressed or not, is for people to have the ability to accumulate capital and earn more money to build things. There is one major problem, however, and that is many mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges across the globe exclude Iran from the list of countries they serve. Thus, many citizens are having to resort to local trading platforms, many of which dont offer the same security or insurance features that exchanges like Coinbase or Binance might offer. This presents an issue in that assets can be stolen or are more vulnerable to cyberattacks. The survey suggests that approximately 83 percent of Iranians invested in digital assets do so through more obscure or smaller exchanges, and that greater exposure to high-ranking trading platforms is necessary if the country is to alleviate its financial strain and build its cryptocurrency backdrop. In addition, many Iranian traders are looking to illegal or questionable means to gain access to more high-profile exchanges. One common method involves purchasing foreign ID cards through the black market, allowing them to satisfy the know your customer (KYC) requirements of these companies without providing their true identities or locations. Song further explains: [Demand for bitcoin] is going to be felt in distressed economies much more than first world economies They feel the impacts of inflation much more.

The currency, despite the harsh trade war conditions that should have put it in a top spot on the financial map, has really failed to rally the way many industry experts thought it would, and at press time, many are hoping the currency can turn itself around before 2020 shows itself. In August, trade war conditions were at their worst. The U.S. and China were at each others throats, with President Donald Trump invoking tariffs on $300 billion new imports from our eastern neighbor, while China swore to retaliate and threw new tariffs of its own into the mix. It was an ugly game of whos stronger than who, with many claiming that average, everyday citizens would eventually get caught in the middle. For the most part, its not necessarily people who have suffered from the trade war, but rather the retailers. Companies like Walmart, which have been warning customers that prices on all China-based goods are likely to experience price spikes in the coming months, meaning people will soon have to pay more for the items they likely use regularly. At the same time, many believed that currencies like bitcoin would ultimately shoot up and experience bull rallies unlike anything weve ever dreamed. In these kinds of conditions, fiat and traditional stock markets tend to lose some of their ground. People begin to put all their money and wealth into non-traditional assets; things like gold, and in this case, bitcoin, which some are beginning to see as digital gold. While this may have happened for a little while, the currency never quite reached where we thought it would. Now, analysts are weighing in on the situation, discussing what could have gone wrong and where the coin will move to in the coming weeks. Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of asset manager Arca, explains: August began with a 20 percent rally in bitcoin led once again by the same macro factors that have supported it for most of this year  endless rate cuts from global Central Banks, declining currencies including the critically important Chinese Yuan, a series of Trump tweets about tariffs and reckless monetary policy, a nasty decline in equities, and, of course, the potentially significant impact of a no-deal Brexit. Unfortunately, the perfect macro storm was erased throughout the rest of the month as these negative correlations broke down and bitcoin and other digital assets ended the month in the red. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto hedge fund Bit Bull Capital, echoed this sentiment, commenting: While global economic factors have served as precursors to bitcoin price movements recently, they have not had any lasting impacts.

BTC must stay above $10,000 and $9,800 to bounce back in the coming sessions. This past week, bitcoin price climbed higher above the $10,800 level against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair even traded close to the $11,000 level. However, it failed to continue higher and topped near the $10,954 level. Recently, there was a fresh decline below the key $10,500 support area. It opened the doors for more downsides below the $10,400 level. Moreover, there was a close below $10,400 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). During the decline, the price broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the last major upward move from the $9,331 low to $10,954 high. The decline was such that the price even broke the $10,000 support area. However, the $9,950 level is acting as a support. Moreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last major upward move from the $9,331 low to $10,954 high is also acting as a support. On the downside, there is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $10,000 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. If there is a downside break below $10,000 and the trend line, there could be more losses. An immediate support is near the $9,800 level plus the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last major upward move from the $9,331 low to $10,954 high. If there is a close below the $9,800 support, bitcoin price could accelerate its decline. In the mentioned bearish case, the price could continue to slide towards the $9,500 level. The next major support is near the $9,400 level and the last swing low. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $10,300 level. However, the main support is near the $10,400 level and the 55 SMA.  Looking at the chart, bitcoin price is clearly trading near a crucial support area at $10,000. If there is a downside break below $9,800, the price could decline heavily. If not, it could bounce back above $10,400. 4 hour MACD  The MACD is currently gaining pace in the bearish zone. 4 hour RSI (Relative Strength Index)  The RSI is currently well below the 45 level.

In a recent interview, Clayton comments that progress is being made when it comes to pushing a bitcoin ETF forward, though the SECs worries havent dissipated completely. There are several companies that have tried for a bitcoin or crypto-based ETF over the years, including the Gemini Exchange founded by the Winklevoss Twins in New York. Unfortunately, many of these ETF proposals have been outright rejected. Among those that have encountered some consideration and success is VanEck Solid X, a joint company which initially filed its proposal in early March of 2017. While this company was rejected at first and results were no different during the second submission, things changed the third time around, paying homage to the saying third times the charm. After three attempts, VanEck Solid X saw its proposal looked at extensively by the SEC. They posted the ETF for public comment and sought expert industry advice regarding whether to permit the ETF. The proposal garnered positive reviews, which ultimately set the SEC in motion regarding a decision for approval. However, a choice was set to be made in August of 2018, over one year ago. This decision was postponed several times until recently, the SEC announced that a final one would occur in October of this year. There will be no pushbacks after this; there will be either a yes or a no answer coming from the agency. Apparently, one of the big worries of the SEC is, and always has been, price manipulation. Clayton recently issued a statement that reiterated these worries again, explaining: An even harder question given that they trade on largely unregulated exchanges is how can we be sure that those prices arent subject to significant manipulation? People needed to answer these hard questions for us to be comfortable that this was the appropriate kind of product. He later commented that the SECs questions werent trivial, and thus found it odd to believe that answers were so difficult to come by. In the middle of everything have been companies like Arca, which has published countless reports for the SEC suggesting why a bitcoin ETF can be very beneficial for traders. Other companies have sought different routes to get what they want. CBOE BZX, for example, which had submitted a crypto-based ETF proposal in 2018, decided to withdraw its outline in 2019 during the government shutdown and refile once the government had reopened. This ETF was largely seen as a primary contender in the race of which ETF would be approved first. ","['Bitcoin ETF', 'Jay Clayton', 'SEC']"

Today is the launch of Apples new iPhone 11, and company executives say theyve been watching bitcoin for some time, with serious interest sparking in the currency earlier this year. The company had previously exhibited a mixed reaction towards digital currency units in the past. Last week, Jennifer Bailey  the vice president of Apple Pay  commented: Were watching cryptocurrency. We think its interesting. We think it has interesting long-term potential. To be fair, however, cryptocurrency has garnered serious attention from tech companies all year, particularly from companies that make phones. Samsung, for example, which is the biggest competitor to Apple, creates the Galaxy mobile phones, which give iPhones a run for their money. The company recently developed what its calling a blockchain key store for its new Galaxy S10 and Note10 models, which allows customers to store the keys to their bitcoin and crypto wallets securely on their phones. Perhaps the biggest attention has come from social media conglomerate Facebook, which is looking to release the new Libra coin sometime next year. However, where Facebook and companies like Apple differ is that Facebook ultimately studied bitcoin just to better understand its structure for its own product. Apple seems to be a legitimate fan, whereas Facebook isnt. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg  the companys CEO  has commented in the past that bitcoin is likely to lead to chaos down the line. Apples comments are more in line with those of Jack Dorsey, the CEO of both payment processor Square and Facebook competitor Twitter. Recently, Dorsey expressed his love for BTC, commenting that it was a solid invention, though he thinks it will be a long time before the currency is stable enough to be used as a method of payment. Apples comments are particularly intriguing as they suggest a massive change in the companys overall attitude towards digital assets. Last month, the enterprise released a new credit card. Many crypto enthusiasts were both shocked and appalled when the company stated that the card could not be used to buy bitcoin or any other virtual currencies. The card was released through a partnership with Goldman Sachs. Per that enterprises user agreement, cryptocurrency buys were out of the question. The card ultimately received mixed reviews from critics, who claimed that the product was lacking innovation. Today, the official announcement of the iPhone 11 will occur in Cupertino, California, the area of Apples headquarters. Two additional versions of the phone called Max and Pro will also be revealed, as well as other products and upgrades to Apple TV and the Apple Watch.

The coin was doing so well following a low period of trading in the $9,000 range and now things have returned to normal somewhat. While the currency isnt in the $9,000 range again or lower, it is trading at around $10,180. This is significantly less than where it was, and bitcoin has once again let down all who were expecting a sudden bull run in the coming days. Its getting annoying to see bitcoin fall so hard as of late. While its always obnoxious to see the coin fall, this time around feels extra hurtful considering how many analysts have been saying that the coin is going to be firing on all cylinders by the end of the year. Many have predicted that the coin will reach $20,000 again come December 2019, just like it did two years ago, and considering that it was trading at nearly $14,000 just two months ago, we all seemed to believe it. These last several weeks have been a relatively wobbly period of growth for bitcoin. While it has gone up here and there, it has gone down several times as well. Its almost, in a way, more annoying to see bitcoin incur virtually no change than it is to see it fall in drastic fashion. Stagnation is never an answer, and its not something that will ever incur the joys or the interest of enthusiasts. Having said all this, we do still have roughly four months in the year left before 2019 exits and 2020  the year of the U.S. presidential election  makes its way into our midst. While its impossible to say for sure, one could argue that 2020 will be the year in which bitcoin really starts to accelerate to the top. Think about this for a moment In 2016, when Donald Trump was elected to the White House, bitcoin, which had had a relatively okay year up to that point, suddenly shot up beyond the $1,000 mark. This was the first time in nearly three years that the coin had garnered such stamina, and many were confident the election had something to do with that. A change in presidents to stimulate economic expansion The following year, bitcoin began its meteoric rise to $20,000, reaching this pinnacle by the time the holiday season rolled out. Perhaps were about to see history repeat itself; in 2020, maybe well begin to see bitcoin really make headway in the financial space like it did in 2016, whereas in 2021, well witness a solid bull run that takes bitcoin to new heights. In 2017, it was $20,000. Perhaps 2021 will offer a doubling of that price, and we can all take our cryptocurrency units to the bank. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Donald Trump']"

Hes now asking the court to issue a ruling on the case. Facebook has been at the center of controversy for several years, starting with its alleged ties to Cambridge Analytica which were discovered in 2018. Facebook had purportedly been selling users private data to third parties for advertising purposes. Mark Zuckerberg was grilled intensely by U.S. senate members regarding the allegations and trust in Facebook has fallen to all-time lows. Ironic that this little scenario would also have to do with advertising. Later, Facebook announced plans to develop Libra, a new global cryptocurrency that it said would be used to power its upcoming payment platform. Libra would be an alleged stable coin, meaning it would be backed by fiat and less vulnerable to the volatility that is often associated with mainstream digital coins like BTC, LTC and ETH. Libra was met with mixed reactions from both critics and the public alike. On the one hand, some thought it would be interesting to see the introduction of a worldwide payment system that saw everyone using the same money regardless of their status, country or credit history. At the same time, several were turned off by the idea that Facebook, a company with a sketchy history regarding peoples private data, would now have access to confidential financial information. Eventually, Libra became its own victim of hype and was subjected to false advertising on fake Facebook pages. De Mol alleges that despite his best efforts, he has been unable to reach an agreement with Facebook regarding measures to stop fake ads. He ultimately filed his lawsuit against the company last June after his name and image were purportedly used for phony bitcoin advertising. An Amsterdam District Court oversaw the case, but initially decided it was best for Facebook and De Mol to reach an agreement on their own without legal interference. In a statement, De Mol explains: After three months of negotiating, it has become clear to me that it is impossible to come to an agreement with Facebook on the misleading bitcoin advertisements. While the company seemed to be cooperating, it was merely smokescreen that concealed its reluctance to put in place the desired measures in a timely and correct manner. While the ads have ultimately been removed, de Mol says that customers were swindled out of nearly $2 million in USD thanks to the advertising. He claims that these ads suggested new crypto exchanges or projects that had garnered financial backing from him, along with several other Dutch celebrities, causing many to invest money and lose out in the end.

Last year, the social media mogul said that the currency would be the only form of money available to people in about ten years. Now, hes saying bitcoin doesnt work as money. Which one is it, buddy? Is bitcoin going to work as a currency or wont it? Dorsey seems to be all over the map in many ways. For one thing, Twitter is still getting a lot of flack for its censorship and attacks on conservative users, while liberal customers can pretty much get away with anything. How is this acceptable? How is it democratic, and above all, how do you feel this is still permissible given you stood in front of several U.S. senators to answers questions about Twitters questionable tactics? Clearly, somethings going on here. Either Dorsey thinks hes above the system or just cant seem to get things together decision-wise and considering his recent comments regarding bitcoin and its functionality, the latters probably more likely. During a recent Australia tour to promote Squares new payment terminals within the country, Dorsey commented that: [Bitcoin is] not functional as a currency. The peaks and troughs are like an investment asset and are equivalent to gold. What we need to do is make it more usable and accessible as a currency, but its not there yet. Has Dorsey not been paying attention? Has he not noticed the introduction of platforms like Flexa which are making it possible for some of the worlds leading retailers (i.e. Jamba Juice, Nordstrom and Whole Foods) to accept crypto payments? Or maybe hes not privy to the fact that Square earned approximately $125 million in bitcoin revenue in 2018? He then tries to top his comments off with a few fluffy words about how great he still thinks BTC is by saying: I think [bitcoin is] the best bet because its been the most resilient. Its around for ten years. It has a great brand and its been tested a bunch. As I look at all cryptocurrencies that could fill that role of being the native currency for the internet, [bitcoin is] a pretty high probability We love you, bitcoin. Interestingly, where we can probably all agree with Dorsey is in his stance towards Libra, the new Facebook cryptocurrency. Dorsey has commented that he cannot endorse such a venture, saying that the currency is likely to be centralized and that open internet standards are likely to serve people better than anything controlled by a single entity. Funny Most people just arent interested in Libra given Facebooks history of manipulating peoples private information. Who wants to go through that again? ","['bitcoin', 'Jack Dorsey', 'Libra']"

Known as Satoshis Treasure, college students will have the chance to search for a $1 million BTC prize. Satoshis Treasure is operated, as one source puts it, by a mysterious company based on a tropical island. Thus, its important to note right away that theres likely to be some risk involved with the venture. Not much is known about the company beforehand, so students should probably be a little wary, though figuring out the companys identity is allegedly part of the game. The entire event is sponsored by Primitive Ventures. Hundreds of separate cryptographic keys will be placed in several hidden locations throughout the globe. It is up to the students participating in the game to find as many as they can. Representative state students will be able to claim the price once they find up to 400 keys and splice them together. At press time, about 40 separate clues have been released regarding the locations of these keys, and as many as 100,000 students have signed up for email updates regarding additional evidence and game participation rules. The games co-creator Eric Meltzer explained in a statement: A lot of these students want to learn about blockchain and crypto, but their universities havent caught up with them yet. Were looking to provide resources for a lot of these different student groups. The game will begin with a North American tour of approximately 20 college campuses which will feature what the creators call mini hunts and educational meetups that focus on decentralized exchanges and crypto wallet technology. Jonathan Calso, who heads a blockchain group at the University of Michigan, says that these workshops are great networking opportunities for students looking to get noticed by schools engineering divisions. He states: This helps us get more visibility from the engineering department, economics and computer science departments as well. The clues incentivize you to discover new websites and tools to play around with a bitcoin wallet a bit and to see what the technology can do. Co-founder of the game Jessica Wang says that shes coordinating activity amongst several university representatives in Asia and Oceania to help students abroad become involved if they so choose. She explains: Students are the future of this industry, so were going to put small prizes, like one bitcoin, into this game to attract mores students. Were going to hide more physical location puzzles globally Were going to have one [key] piece at a university in Asia and another in a university in the U.S., so theyre going to need to network with each other Top cryptography foundations and teams will create more puzzles on their end.

Just think. By Christmas, everybodys favorite cryptocurrency could be worth a whopping $20,000. This wouldnt be the first time. The currency nearly struck this mark by the end of 2017, and whats interesting is that by this time that year (September), bitcoin was trading for about $5,000 per unit. At press time, its more than double this amount. Naturally, this raises many questions, the biggest one being, If bitcoin can jump by $15,000 within three months, why cant it do so again? This time around, if bitcoin were to reach $20,000, it would only need to jump by about $10,000. The space is much thinner, and if bitcoin is as resilient as its proven to be since April, perhaps that $20,000 prediction isnt terribly out of the question. One enthusiast who believes bitcoin is about to strike it big is Beth Moses, the astronaut thats training billionaire Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines to be the first entrepreneur in space. Branson is seeking to expand Virgin into Virgin Galactic, which will feature space travel and exploration in the coming years, and as she looks down on the earth from 56 miles away, she comments that blockchain has indeed created a world thats borderless. The technology behind bitcoin has many powers, one of which involves attaching businesses from all corners of the world. As this continues, the demand for blockchain will grow. Well see more businesses integrate its technology, which means bitcoin is likely to expand further. With that expansion will come price boosts. But the reasons dont quite stop there. One big change were witnessing in the crypto space as of late is the addition of crypto-related insurance to prevent people from falling victim to hacks and malicious online activity. To this day, cryptocurrencies are still heavily vulnerable to cybercriminals who seek to take coins or tokens that arent theirs. Were now witnessing many more exchanges and crypto businesses alike offering insurance plans for their customers to ensure their money stays safe, even in the event of a hack. If they ever lose their funds, theyll be replaced immediately. This suggests that crypto is being treated more like traditional fiat, which is often protected through FICO insurance in standard banks. Thus, crypto is becoming a safer bet for many, which means more will arrive to invest. More investments mean more price rises. And to top it all off are new regulations designed for private enterprise blockchains seeking to earn their keep in the financial space. The more we can regulate, the more secure the space will become, which will in turn attract more people and lead to heavier price spikes as people invest.

According to Bill Barhydt, CEO of bitcoin investment platform Abra, the company originally wanted to implement code that would have made bitcoin its global cryptocurrency of choice, but that scalability issues forced them to start from scratch and start their own cryptocurrency. At ten years old, bitcoin is the oldest form of virtual money. To this day, it is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and enjoys the most users. It has also experienced the most bullish behavior in 2019, trading for about $10,480 at press time. This is $5,000 more than where it stood in early April of this year, and about $7,000 more than where it was during late 2018. Originally, the idea was that bitcoin could potentially power the new Facebook payment platform(s). Unfortunately, bitcoins inability to scale made this very difficult for Facebook executives to implement it, meaning they had to hire developers and coding experts to create an entirely new digital asset  in this case, Libra. For the most part, Libra has been subjected to mixed reviews. Many members of the U.S. Congress expressed skepticism that the company would implement the appropriate security measures when it came to keeping peoples financial data safe and sound. The company had already proven itself untrustworthy in 2018 when founder Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by Senate members for allegedly selling private data to third parties for advertising purposes, so the idea that such a venture would now weave its way into the financial industry was a little scary. In a recent interview, Barhydt said that he had spoken with many people at Facebook, who often claimed that it wasnt their original intention to create an entirely new cryptocurrency, but rather a payment system that satisfied their users needs. He says: Ideally  from my discussion  they actually would have preferred to use bitcoin. I think theres a huge belief in the system, but if you want to build a remittance system and you want to build a cross-border commerce system and you have 1.2 billion users today, what would happen to bitcoin? Fees would skyrocket. Doing anything with bitcoin that was transactional was effectively untenable. For the most part, leaders at Facebook tried to consider all items, including the Lightning Network, but that in the end, bitcoin was simply out of the question: These are smart people. Theyve looked at Lightning, theyve looked at bitcoin, theyve thought this through, and they realized that bitcoin is not optimized to be a payment network. Bitcoin is optimized to be digital cash right now. Bitcoin seems to be the currency of choice amongst internet entrepreneurs, with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey previously claiming it will be the only form of currency in ten years.

Known as Glupteba malware, it uses the bitcoin network to resist potential attacks, according to cybersecurity researchers. Glupteba is dangerous in the sense that it uses the blockchain to update itself. This means that regardless of how the blockchain changes or grows in the future, the malware changes with it, so it can continue to run even if its blocked by a devices antivirus software. First discovered in late 2018, the malware spreads to mobile or computer devices through script advertising. It can steal website cookies, browsing history, passwords and account names, along with other personal information that is often shared between websites and internet sources. However, researchers also say it is being used to mine the Monero currency, which makes it a form of crypto jacking software. Crypto jacking has become a highly popular method amongst hackers looking to obtain coins and digital assets that arent theirs. The malware infects a computer system, which allows the hacker in question to utilize someones computer to mine cryptocurrencies without the original owners permission or knowledge. Typically, Monero is the cryptocurrency of choice amongst hackers that employ crypto jacking methods given its quasi-anonymous properties. All the while, the hacker is mining new coins and making a solid profit while the original owner earns nothing unless one counts the high energy bills that theyre forced to pay each month. Lastly, researchers claim that the malware can potentially be used to infiltrate peoples Instagram accounts. It also utilizes the Electrum bitcoin wallet to transfer any funds a hacker may have mined or stolen and to gain access to additional systems. Trend Micro researchers explain: This technique makes it more convenient for the threat actor to replace command and control servers. If they lose control of a command and control server for any reason, they simply need to add a new bitcoin script and the infected machines obtain a new command and control server by decrypting the script data and reconnecting. Command and control servers are centralized networks that issue digital commands to infected devices, thereby allowing the malware to move about freely. Recently, legendary investor Mark Mobius claimed that the blockchain wasnt as safe as we all thought, and after reading this story, its easy to see hes probably right. While the bitcoin blockchain is often touted as one of the most secure forms of new technology to exist today, the crypto market is still wrought with problems that can potentially lead ones private data to wind up in the wrong hands. Malware seemingly has a way of appearing when we least expect and in ways were not used to. ","['bitcoin', 'crypto-jacking', 'Glupteba', 'Malware']"

Professor of finance John Griffin at the University of Texas recently published a whole report suggesting that Tether users were responsible for the abnormal spikes in the bitcoin price during 2017, and now it appears that manipulation is occurring again in a different form. New evidence has emerged supporting the idea that bitcoin hasnt been rising naturally since the currency first entered its present bull phase in April of 2019. While the currency initially peaked in July and shot up over $13,000, it has since fallen back down and is trading at around $10,862 at press time. This is still a solid price compared to where bitcoin was at this time last year; in addition, it seems to be on a solid run when compared to how it was doing just two weeks ago, and that could be the problem. Everyone knows that Google searches surrounding bitcoin and the currency itself are tied together. When people are interested in BTC and perform cryptocurrency-related searches on the internet, the currencys price tends to move up. When people show a lack of interest, the price will fall. Its being suggested that someone is manipulating bitcoin internet searches as a means of pushing the price forward. According to researchers at the crypto news and analysis site Kryptografen, the widespread internet searches for BTC this week are higher than any week in 2017, when bitcoin first experienced its record-breaking bull run that first brought it to nearly $20,000 per unit. Norheim Schei, an analyst at the site, believes that the trouble may have originated in Romania, commenting: It is reasonable to assume that someone is behind these radical changes. That the same pattern can be seen all over the world may indicate that VPN services have been used to distribute the search across the world, thus achieving a global trend. Google Trends points that that changes have been relatively large in Romania. Is this the source, or is it just because there have been fewer searches for BTC previously? Whatever the answer is, something very strange has happened to the interest in the keyword BTC this past week. Many analysts agree with this sentiment, including Glen Goodman, who wrote the bitcoin investment book The Crypto Trader. In a recent interview, he states: Somebodys trying to game the trading algorithms. There are algorithms programmed to look at Google Trends data and try to find correlation between numbers of searches for the word BTC and the movements in the bitcoin price. If they detect patterns, it may be profitable to trade off that data. This hacker may be buying some BTC, then sending a ton of BTC search queries to Google.

The organization, headed by Ray Youssef, states that it has teamed up with a crypto startup known as Coinlogiq to implement the machines within Colombias infrastructure. Citizens of both Bogota, the countrys capital, and Medellin will now able to engage in BTC transactions using fiat money and other forms of crypto. Magdiela Rivas, Paxfuls manager for Latin America, explained in a statement: The peer-to-peer financial revolution continues to mature in Latin America. This alliance between Paxful and Coinlogiq will contribute to the adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrencies among Colombians and Latin Americans in general. South America has been one of the most active regions when it comes to implementing new crypto-based financial strategies. Some have been quite successful. For example, Brazil has become one of the southern hemispheres most prominent areas for bitcoin usage, having birthed several meetups and organizations based around crypto activity. At the same time, other examples show just how tricky crypto use can be when coins are mismanaged. The biggest example of this is Venezuelas new national cryptocurrency known as the Petro. The coin is allegedly backed by the countrys man oil reserves, yet theres no mention of this in the currencys whitepaper. Furthermore, Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has tried implementing a new system in which workers are paid in Petro funds rather than the national form of fiat the bolivar, but this has seemingly failed to catch on. There has been so much controversy surrounding the cryptocurrency since it first emerged that U.S. President Donald Trump has banned all Petro trading within the U.S. Paxful, on the other hand, has proven time and time again that it knows what its customers want, and the addition of 20 new bitcoin ATMs makes for a solid step forward. What really sets them aside from other crypto-based ATM machines is that these come with whats known as the Paxful Kiosk, which allows Colombians to trade tokens and digital assets in for gift cards, debit cards, and other financial options they otherwise wouldnt have access to. Paxful CEO Ray Youssef comments: Latin America has real heroes in the CoinLogiq crew. They genuinely care and are focused on real use cases. This is what makes bitcoin real and a part of peoples daily lives. At press time, Colombia has more cryptocurrency ATMs than any other nation in South America, boasting a whopping 46 individual machines and accounting for roughly 0.7 percent of the worlds total bitcoin ATMs. The addition of 20 more machines will push the country beyond the one percent mark.

The idea regarding blockchain is that its amongst the safest forms of technology out there. Blockchain creates irrefutable evidence that transactions have occurred. They cannot be tampered with once they have been set in stone via the blockchain. The technology is allegedly more secure and much more stable than anything a standard bank can offer its clients. Unfortunately, Mobius is looking to challenge this idea. He says that at the end of the day, while blockchain does indeed offer several benefits, it is still a man-made creation, and anything built by man can be undone by man. In other words, blockchain is still vulnerable and can be broken into. In an interview with CNBC, the investing partner claims: A lot of people say, blockchain cant be broken into. No, it can be. Anything thats created by man can be broken into. And it could create a big crisis Theres a whole generation of people who have faith in the internet. They have faith in these cryptocurrencies. Thats all it takes. People believe in the U.S. dollar because they have faith that with dollars in their hands, they can buy something. One of the big problems with bitcoin and other forms of crypto  according to Mobius  is that since many of them are not centralized, theyre quite difficult to regulate. As most forms of fiat are issued by central banks, cryptocurrencies arent. Theres no central figure or agency pulling the strings or deciding what should occur within the space. Thus, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies tend to play by their own rules, making them harder to handle by financial authorities. For the most part, Mobius is convinced that crypto and blockchain remain very risky (and sketchy) ventures, and hes confident that people will see the light in the coming days. He comments: I think people are going to begin to realize that these are very, very risky situations. And by the way, I believe blockchain is a very high-risk situation. At the same time, he does believe that a cryptocurrency backed by a more stable asset like gold would be a very interesting notion. He mentions: If there is a cryptocurrency that is really backed by gold and there is a meaningful agreement and some kind of modern thing of this connection, then this could be quite interesting. Gold, for the most part, is considered one of the most stable assets available to investors.

This is a shade better than where it was yesterday when it originally fell from $10,700+. The price of bitcoin has been going through several highs and lows over the past two weeks. Originally, the currency had been trading in the $10,000 range for quite some time, only to suddenly (and unexpectedly) fall into the mid-$9,000 range and reach a low of $9,400, a price it hadnt been trapped at in some time. Now the price has moved back up, which is certainly reason to celebrate. At the same time, however, how long are we expected to just sit around and wait for bitcoin to move and potentially reach new heights? It meanders all over the financial ladder and doesnt seem to shift positions as often. This is good in the sense that perhaps the coin is stabilizing somewhat, but its still not at the $13,000 high it was at in early July. Two months ago, bitcoin seemed poised to strike 2017 territory, but that seemingly hasnt happened yet. One source brings up an interesting question: has bitcoin become boring? This piece is looking at the technical charts and trying to make light of the trends that seem to be following bitcoin everywhere it goes as of late. Sadly, its not suggesting that bitcoin will reach the same heights that it did at the end of 2017, which can mean only one thing: if were lucky, bitcoin will stay as it is or move just slightly higher. Best case scenario is that it doesnt drop any further, but for a lot of us, this simply wont do. Were eager to get back to the days of when bitcoin shot up without warning; when it expanded and added several hundred (or several thousand dollars) to its price within a set period. Those days were exciting, and while bitcoin has indeed shown bullish behavior since April of this year, we cant help but want more. Apparently, this happens with many different assets, gold being a primary subject. One ounce of gold has shot up this year into the $1,400 and $1,500 ranges. The problem, however, is that an ounce of gold was trading in the $1,200 range just a few years ago. Thus, not much has happened with gold in the long run. Gold is an interesting asset in that its designed to remain stable throughout economic turmoil. Thus, in many ways, it makes sense that the asset wouldnt move around as much. However, bitcoin seems to be taking a similar path, and its unclear if (or when) it might show more signs of an oncoming rally. Lets not forget, though, that theres still four months left in the year, and that with crypto, anything can happen. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Gold']"

Bitcoin IRA is the first IRA to devote itself entirely to cryptocurrency. Other IRAs focus largely on fiat or on precious metals like gold, but with Bitcoin IRA, you can see your wealth grow based on how well cryptocurrency does. Customers can purchase an array of different cybercurrencies for their retirement accounts. Thus far, it has processed well over $300 million in investments and garnered over 4,000 clients in just the last three years alone. The company is now integrating whats called an ABS biometric security process which utilizes facial recognition to ensure the person accessing the account is who they say they are. The new feature will be integrated today and will be extended to the companys self-trading system later in the month. Chris Kline, the COO of Bitcoin IRA, explains: Security is of paramount importance to self-directed cryptocurrency investors. In addition to our world-class custody security offering with Bit Go Trust, our new feature elevates the standard in the industry by going beyond traditional security methods. Bitcoin IRA joined hands with Bit Go earlier in June. The partnership offers new customers trading fees at a 30 percent discount. Bit Go also provides Bitcoin IRA with more than $100 million in custody insurance, along with military-grade security which includes top-level bank vaults. While adding to ones retirement is a necessity if one wants to remain stable in their later years, its important to be aware of the risks associated with retiring on crypto. Digital currency, as we all know, tends to be quite volatile. Bitcoin itself recently fell to about $9,400 despite trading well above $10,000 beforehand. At the same time, it later rose to about $10,700 following news that the VanEck Solid X Bitcoin Trust was on the verge of offering shares to institutional traders following several delays and negative reception from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At press time, the coin has dropped a bit to around $10,400. The fact is that cryptocurrencies are still too vulnerable to price swings, and people need to remain careful if theyre going to build a retirement nest egg on something that remains extremely volatile. Their life savings could either go very high, or they could go very low, though in cryptocurrencys defense, the same applies to stocks. Most 401Ks, for example, are centered in the stock market, which can go up or down depending on the emotions of the countrys economy. If something positive happens or if sentiment is good, the market will go up, whereas it can fall backwards as soon as a politician or economist says something nasty.

This is slightly less than where it stood yesterday (about $300), but many analysts still see bitcoin as entering another bull phase. The news behind the recent price bump has to do with the fact that the VanEck Solid X Bitcoin Trust, after many delays, is ready to start handing out shares to institutional traders this coming week. This sent the currency skyrocketing to well above $10,000 after a solid week in the doldrums in which the currency fell to the mid-$9,000 range. At its lowest, bitcoin was trading for less than $9,500, which means that the coin surged by roughly $1,300 in just a few days. Overall, the currency has increased by about 11 percent, while other competing altcoins, like Litecoin and Ethereum have increased by about five percent. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone mentions: All the signs are there that institutions are interested, and this, to me, is part of that trend. It looks like it could continue to go up and its got some good reasons. Not all analysts share this sentiment, however. Ed Moya, chief market strategist at Oanda Corp. believes that the rally is only a temporary event, explaining: Security vulnerabilities and stricter regulatory hurdles are likely to keep this rally short-lived. We could see this rebound be temporary. One source suggests that if bitcoin is to reach $20,000 again, it will likely be thanks to China. The United States and China have been engaged in a hardcore trade war for the past several months, and the trend is that whenever something negative happens, bitcoin shoots up. We dont always know what it is or what to expect, but the currency does do well whenever economic circumstances look bleak. If the trade war continues, BTC will continue to spike, and the source suggests that this will be the case. No side, neither China nor the U.S., has shown restraint in how they handle the situation, and neither appears willing to buckle. After all, theres a lot to lose if they do. Trade wars lead to serious financial losses, and there are growing fears of a recession exploding at every corner. Given the situation, the trade war isnt likely to let up, and we may see bitcoin spike to $20,000 again by the end of the year like it did in 2017. Its easy to think that with only four months left in 2019, bitcoin doesnt have enough time to shoot up that high. However, this was the case two years ago; bitcoin was trading in the $5,000 range in September and had shot up another $15,000 by the time December rolled around, so perhaps the idea isnt as strange as some might think.

BTC is showing positive signs and it could rise further towards the $10,950 and $11,200 resistances. This past week, bitcoin price extended its decline below the key $9,780 support against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair even broke the $9,500 support and settled below the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Finally, the price traded as low as $9,331 and later formed a solid support base near the $9,340 level. As a result, the price started a strong upward move above the $9,500 and $9,780 resistance levels. Moreover, there was a break above a crucial bearish trend line with resistance near $9,980 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. It opened the doors for more gains above the $10,000 resistance and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). The pair even surged above the $10,500 resistance level. It traded as high as $10,784 recently and it is currently correcting gains. An immediate support is near $10,440 plus the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $9,331 low to $10,784 high. If there is an extended downside correction, the price could trade towards the $10,220 and $10,200 support levels. The next key support is near the $10,000 level since it coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $9,331 low to $10,784 high. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $$10,780 and $10,800 levels. A successful break above the $10,800 level could accelerate gains above the $10,900 level. The next target for the bulls may perhaps be near the $11,200 level, where the bearish might appear.  Looking at the chart, bitcoin price is clearly trading with a positive trend above the $10,440 and $10,220 support levels. In the short term, there could be a downside correction below $10,440, but the price is likely to find buyers near $10,220 or $10,000. 4 hour MACD  The MACD is currently reducing its bullish slope. 4 hour RSI (Relative Strength Index)  The RSI is currently correcting lower from well above the 75 level. Key Support Levels  $10,440 and $10,220. Key Resistance Levels  $10,780, $10,950 and $11,200. ","['bitcoin', 'BTC']"

Bitcoin, at press time has moved past $10,700. This is the highest its been in several weeks, and many believe the spike has something to do with the VanEck Solid X Bitcoin Trust, which according to recent reports, is about ready to start releasing shares to institutional players. This has been a long-time coming; the trust has experienced delay after delay, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has appeared practically frightened of making any decision regarding the trust. After a lengthy period of inactivity, it seems that the trust is finally here and ready to get moving. At the same time, XRP  the official cryptocurrency of Ripple  hasnt managed to do anything similar. The coin is trading at a particularly low point given how angry some investors are that the company, Ripple, is selling XRP units in the name of funding various other ventures. At press time, XRP has risen roughly two percent. One Twitter user recently commented on the circumstances surrounding the token, claiming: Im thinking about forking XRP, so we dont have to deal with the founders dumping. This will be a community effort. [Ripple chief executive] Brad Garlinghouse, [and Ripple chief technology officer] Joel Katz, you now have 60 days to stop dumping XRP or we will stage a community takeover. If its a decentralized network like you say, we have the power to do it. Ripple has stirred quite a bit of controversy in the financial space given that its a far more centralized coin. While executives claim that it possesses decentralized properties, the company still owns more than 50 percent of all XRP units, which goes against the basic nature of a decentralized cryptocurrency. Many have since entered a lawsuit against Ripple for potentially lying to investors and offering an unregistered security. Since the beginning of the year, Ripples price has fallen around 25 percent, a huge difference to how bitcoin has been doing. Garlinghouse has ultimately defending XRP and Ripples decision-making processes, stating: Reality is, we decreased our sales by volume quarter on quarter and since then the inflation rate of XRP circulating supply has been lower than that of bitcoin and ether. A petition has since emerged asking Ripple executives to stop dumping XRP. It has thus far garnered over 3,000 signatures and reads: Ripple continues dumping billions of XRP on us, crashing the price. Its amazing this sort of behavior is widely accepted in the crypto world. Sure, we know that XRP is a solid coin with major potential, but this needs to stop! ","['bitcoin', 'Brad Garlinghouse', 'Ripple', 'XRP']"

The currency is trading for well over $10,000. In fact, its trading for roughly $10,700. The currency has risen by almost $1,000 in the last 24 hours. This last week has been hard for the granddaddy of cryptocurrency (and its enthusiasts). It ultimately fell by more than $600 in less than 30 minutes early in the week and nobody could really explain why. Since then, it hovered in the mid-$9,000 range for several days and has now jumped back into more familiar territory. The currency has been enjoying bullish behavior since April, but it has fallen here and there for unexplained reasons. Now that the currency is back up, people cant help but rejoice, but its unclear if the currency will stay here, continue to move up, or ultimately fall back down again. Naturally, traders are hoping the currency continues its current streak. The fact that it could spike roughly $1,000 in just 24 hours is a solid position for bitcoin, and after all, the currency has been proving itself since the end of the first quarter. The news has emerged that the VanEck Solid X Bitcoin Trust could start selling shares to institutional players as early as next week. This is the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) to submit a proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and thus far, the attention its been getting surpasses that of all its competitors. VanEck initially tried to submit the proposal for the ETF in March of 2017, a time when bitcoins price was really moving up the financial ladder. Ultimately, the ETF was rejected and turned down by the SEC, and it took the company two more tries before the agency even began considering what it had to offer. From there, a period of public comment was given to VanEck so that the SEC could understand if it was in the worlds best interest to allow a bitcoin ETF to enter the market. The idea of a fund backed by physical bitcoin was unique Perhaps a little too unique, and the SEC didnt know how to approach it. Following the commentary period, the SEC sought to gather these comments and make an official decision, but this was delayed time and time again. Now, it appears the final decision is upon VanEck, and with the sudden price rise, maybe things are looking down on the company in a favorable way. Jan van Eck, chief executive officer of VanEck, said in a statement: Institutional demand for bitcoin exposure is uncertain because institutional quality vehicles simply have not, to this point, been readily available. Were introducing a solution for institutions that fits within their operational processes and the currency regulatory framework. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'VanEck SolidX']"

Hes also very accomplished. The dude has gone from a World Boxing Association super welterweight champion to a senator in his home country of the Philippines.

The PAC is the new official digital asset released by Manny Pacquiao. The currency was launched last Sunday during a free concert in Manila  the capital city of the Philippines  in which Pacquiao was the primary singer! Is there anything this man cannot do? The former boxing champion performed covers of several old love songs, all of which are available on his latest album. The PAC is being referred to as the first celebrity cryptocurrency. The coin is presently funded by several famous faces including former England and Liverpool FC footballer Michael Owen and Sheikh Khaled bin Zayed al-Nahyan, whos part of Abu Dhabis ruling family in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The coin is now listed on Singapores global crypto exchange known as GCOX. Founder and CEO of the exchange Jeffrey Lin explained to potential customers: We are not here to raise a lot of money, but to build an ecosystem.

Initially announced in 2018, the PAC Coin was originally slated for release during the final months of 2018 but was then pushed to the first quarter of 2019. Now, nine months later, the currency is finally ready for trading and selling. Through PAC coin, fans will be able to purchase merchandise related to Pacquiao and his boxing endeavors. They can also use it to interact with him on social media. This isnt the first time that celebrities have endorsed crypto. Another boxing legend  Floyd Mayweather  along with musician and Snapchat king DJ Khaled tied themselves to a cryptocurrency known as Centra, based in Miami.

It looks like another bitcoin exchange has shut down. This time, the unsuspecting victim is Bitcoin Co. Ltd. (BX.in.th), one of the most popular trading platforms in Thailand. The company announced that no more deposits can be made after this week and that all trading will cease by September 30. At press time, no reason has been given for the closure, though executives have stated that they are going to focus on other business opportunities. The exchange put out a statement reading: We thank our loyal customers for using our BX.in.th services over the past five years and trust you have been happy with the services provided. Please note that all fund[s] are completely safe and all customers will receive 100 percent of their funds returned to them. Its good news to know that customers will not be cheated out of what theyve deposited or purchased. All customers will receive their funds back upon the companys official end, with money transferred either into standard bank accounts or third-party wallets by November 1 of this year. However, bitcoin is trading as low as $6,500 per unit on the exchange. Thats about $3,500 less than where one unit is trading globally. In addition, the company will have no operational license from the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the next year, meaning it will not be functioning as a cryptocurrency exchange over a 12-month period. The company has chosen not to renew its license for the time being. The situation has led to panic among investors, who are concerned about the low trading prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Thailand. It has also led to malicious actors entering the scene. The SEC recently warned of a phony Facebook account claiming to be associated with the platform attempting to divert and steal from respective traders. Since the mid-point of this year, cryptocurrency exchanges, especially new ones, have proven vulnerable to negative circumstances that invoke shutdowns. Among the most recent victims is Cryptopia, a digital currency trading company based in New Zealand. The company suffered a serious breach in January of this year that caused thousands of dollars in assorted crypto funds to disappear overnight. While the company initially tried to pass the situation off as maintenance when people couldnt access their accounts, Cryptopia eventually decided that liquidation was the best option for both customers and executives. Another victim comes in the form of Coinome, a popular crypto exchange stationed in India up through mid-May. India has had a very mixed relationship with crypto and has even considered prison time for digital asset traders. The country has been struggling to implement proper crypto regulation for nearly two years, and exchanges like Coinome and ZebPay have disappeared as a result. ","['Bitcoin Co.

The good news is that bitcoin has moved beyond $9,900 and the Lightning Network can potentially make cryptocurrency (BTC) payments faster (something many of us already knew). The bad news is that alleged security flaws have been found in the Network that could cause people to lose their funds granted nodes arent updated properly. Software developer Rusty Russell  who developed most of the Lightning Networks protocol  announced on September first that: Security issues have been found in various Lightning projects which could cause the loss of funds. Full details will be released in four weeks. Please upgrade well before then. The official problems associated with the Network will be disclosed to users on September 27. One is probably thinking why wait so long if peoples funds are potentially in danger. This is standard procedure designed to give developers a chance to fix the security problems at hand while preventing hackers from exploiting the weak points in the Lightning Networks software. At press time, it appears the primary issues stem from clair, a lightning-ready bitcoin wallet. Russell is telling all users to update these wallets quickly. Recently, Live Bitcoin News covered a new application known as Tippin, in which people could send bitcoin tips to individuals via Twitter. Granted they chose to use their mobile devices rather than their computers, they could send money to friends and family through the Lightning Network, guaranteeing that funds would arrive within minutes to the receivers wallets. Last April, the crypto spaces first official Lightning-based digital currency exchange opened for business. The Lightning Network was first developed in 2015 by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon. The platform develops a new layer atop the bitcoin blockchain. This layer allows transactions to move back and forth before officially being added to the blockchain system, and clearly theres a lot riding on the Networks success. Unfortunately, the system is still a relatively new addition to the arena of cryptocurrency, meaning that it doesnt boast a solid user base. The lack of users ultimately causes lightning nodes to lose money whenever transactions are sent through, so while speeds are increased tenfold, a piece of every transaction winds up disappearing. Through the Lightning Network, two parties or individuals can deposit bitcoin funds into a single wallet address, also known as a channel. From there, they can exchange funds without limits, and granted these payments are small and occur on a regular basis, they are never considered important enough to add to bitcoins blockchain until the channel is closed by one or both of the parties. Many are confident that the Lightning Network can lead to greater adoption of bitcoin, which could lead to exponential growth in its price.

How does that work, exactly? It seems like people who see a sign that says out of order would be deterred from using the machine. Theyd turn away and try to utilize another machine or decide against their transaction. Well, apparently things didnt quite stop there. These allegedly non-functioning machines also came with signs asking customers to scan a QR code that was attached to the machines so that they could still purchase bitcoins. The idea was that anyone who bought bitcoins through the QR code would attach themselves to a bitcoin address owned by the thieves. Thus, any money unsuspecting persons bought would ultimately wind up in the hands of the criminals. One can see from first glance that this con makes no sense. You put a sign on a machine saying out of order to give people the impression that any time spent on or with the machine is wasted, yet you still ask them to scan a code so they can purchase more crypto units? People proved too smart to fall for this ridiculously silly ploy, and the hackers have thus far walked away with nothing. The good news is that only two signs were hung on two different machines, so the hackers didnt try to initiate anything too serious. Maybe they, themselves, didnt entirely trust their own plan or lacked confidence somehow. Nevertheless, the police still got involved in the case and put up warning signs on the machines granted anybody couldnt fully understand what was going on (thankfully, this wasnt the case). This isnt the first time that scammers have utilized cryptocurrency ATMs to get their fingers on funds that werent theirs. A similar scenario occurred in Australia last year, when cybercriminals tried to scam immigrants who were using bitcoin ATMs. The ploy involved telling the immigrants to place fiat money into a bitcoin ATM and convert it to cryptocurrency, which they would then have to send to a specific cryptocurrency address. This would serve as a special tax debt and excuse the immigrants from deportation. Most other forms of cryptocurrency theft occur in ways that are more complicated, such as SIM-swapping or phony initial coin offerings (ICOs). The former involves bribing employees of a persons cellphone provider to garner their passwords and user information for mobile accounts (i.e. crypto accounts), while the latter involves raising money for a new venture or startup only to make off with the funds before the business ever comes to fruition (probably because it never existed).

This must be taken with a grain of salt, of course, for two very big reasons. The first is that bitcoin, at press time, is trading for just over $9,600. Nobody has been able to explain why the granddaddy of crypto suddenly dropped more than $600 in less than 30 minutes earlier this week. It was originally trading at a solid $10,200, but later fell to a new weekly low. Why has bitcoin suddenly become so vulnerable to volatility following a solid run in early 2019? Second, one cant help but wonder if Mexicos economy is truly as bad as analysts claim. The United States places over $300 million a year into the countrys infrastructure in the hopes that officials will potentially build jobs and businesses and bring the country out of the doldrums. Naturally, there is some benefit to Americans if this happens. To be able to do business with a neighbor to the south presents many solid financial and business opportunities, especially for manufacturing. It also gives the U.S. a road out of China, which the country is currently engaged in a serious trade war with. Granted it can move some of its manufacturing sites to a country thats much closer, the U.S. stands to benefit greatly. However, the word on the street is that Mexico is losing much of its financial stamina. In many ways, the country is suffering from whats called a technical recession. The nation, following some severely negative financial policies, has seen its economic growth die down two quarters in a row. President Andrew Manuel Lopez Obrador doesnt appear to be worried, however, recently exclaiming: Now that there is growth and better income distribution, most Mexicans have more purchasing power. Thats why Im not very concerned about the matter. Mexico is one of the highest-ranking remittance countries in the world, meaning many out-of-state workers are sending money back home, but Mexican banks charge heavy fees (as high as seven percent in some cases) to do this. Thus, bitcoin is looking more and more comforting to many Mexican workers. The cryptocurrency would allow some of the nations poorest people to lose less money each time funds are moved around. In addition, any platforms allowing them to pay with bitcoin would relieve them from all dependence on costly transaction platforms. Lastly, more people in Mexico will be given a solid opportunity to store value and boost their net worth, thereby improving their living situations and boosting the countrys financial stability.

The application occurs over Twitter. Users can send BTC via tweets and through the Lightning Network should they choose to utilize their mobile phones instead of their computers. This coming week, an alpha version of the platform will be available for a testing phase on Android devices. These devices will also come equipped with Lightning Network enabled wallets. The company has also said that its looking to release an iOS version of the app in the coming weeks, but users can test out the demo theyve prepared via Twitter. Anyone who utilizes Twitter can be tipped or do the tipping themselves. The application originally started out as a browser extension launched in February of this year by Sergio Abril, a Spanish architect who refers to Tippin as a very personal project. It appears the app has already gained an astounding 14,000 users following heavy praise from Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey. Many fans are certain that the application will push bitcoin well into mainstream territory. The use of the Lightning Network allows bitcoin payments to occur speedily, ensuring customers earn their money in a matter of minutes, rather than hours or days. Bitcoin is often referred to as the slowest blockchain available today given its age and position in the crypto space, and the Lightning Network  while still relatively new  has worked to ensure bitcoin enthusiasts garner their funds at faster rates. As great as all this sounds, Tippin is likely to experience some fierce competition down the line. In early August, the makers of the Brave browser  an allegedly much more private internet search engine  added their own tipping application to Twitter that allowed people to tip others in Basic Attention Tokens, otherwise known as BATs. Interestingly, while both platforms are likely to garner a lot of attention in the coming months, bitcoin and cryptocurrency tipping is nothing new. The concept has been around virtually since 2014 as one can see by online chat forums such as Quora in which enthusiasts delve into the idea of tipping people with BTC during a time when the cryptocurrency was barely trading in the $1,000 range. The ability to tip others in BTC was technically available during this time, yet it wasnt particularly common, and the idea that a social media conglomerate like Twitter would later add such capabilities to its own platform was unheard of. Even when Tippin first came out last February, Twitter was reluctant to bring the app aboard. The company suddenly changing its mind is clear evidence that the currency is garnering stronger attention and moving up the financial ladder.

Many organizations in foreign nations, including Cielo in Brazil and Bitwala in Europe, are looking to make it easier for customers to get their fingers on digital currencies for payments and investment purposes. Cielo is a payment processing firm stationed in Brazil, a country that presently houses more than 200 million people. The company announced its support for bitcoin and other digital assets through a press release, stating that customers can now make bitcoin purchases through the enterprises point-of-sale devices by creating respective accounts with any of its network partners. These devices then develop special QR codes which customers can scan using any partner-based apps. Towards the end of the year, customers will be able to purchase cryptocurrencies through Cielo, a first for the company and for many individuals in Brazil. The crypto presence within the South American nation has been growing steadily over the years, and Cielo is about to increase that presence tenfold. Bitcoin has long been popular within Brazils borders, with platforms such as O Globo reporting that many people are more invested in bitcoin then they are in standard stock shares. Last February, the countrys largest bank announced that it was looking to raise $15 million for a new digital token it had developed. 5,000 miles away, a company called Bitwala has allegedly garnered the same idea in its head. Based in Germany, the company is launching a new banking application containing an integrated bitcoin wallet. Bitwala is looking to offer its services in more than 30 countries throughout Europe. At press time, the application is only available for iOS or Android devices, but the process of obtaining a Bitwala account is relatively simple. Residents must first open an account with a German bank through a video identification function. From there, they can begin making euro deposits (as many as 100,000 euros at a time) which can then be transferred into BTC. Customers will also obtain a Mastercard-based crypto debit card for any future transactions. A statement for Bitwala explains: The current accounts are hosted by Solaris Bank, the Berlin-based tech platform with a German banking license and are supervised by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Ba Fin). Bitwala executives claim that the bitcoin wallets available with each app download can be used for everyday expenses such as food, clothing and utility payments. In addition, customers can also obtain private keys that will allow them to send BTC funds to friends and family members. Bitwala has been around since December of 2018. Last month, the company raised an astounding 13 million euros from companies like the Sony Corporation in Japan. ","['bitcoin', 'bitwala', 'brazil', 'Cielo']"

This week, that support comes from Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England  one of the worlds largest and oldest financial institutions. Carney has not always been kind to cryptocurrencies in the past. He has often spoken ill of bitcoin and is certainly not a fan of Libra. Hes concerned about the prospects of Facebook collecting peoples financial information and has long sought the introduction of hardcore regulation to ensure the space remains safe for customers. But now, it appears Carney is switching gears. In a recent interview, the governor spoke positively regarding the idea of a global digital currency that everyone around the world could use regardless of their location or credit history. Interestingly, his ideas sound strangely similar with those of bitcoin, a currency Carney hasnt been friendly to in the past. What could get him to perform such a serious turnaround? It appears his concerns stem from the U.S. dollars dominance in global trade. Right now, many governments around the world have several USD units stored away granted their economies ever tank unexpectedly. Thus, if the global economy were to ever fall to irreparable conditions, they have reserves of the worlds most dominant currency to remain afloat. Carney isnt too happy about this. He claims: [A digital currency] could dampen the domineering influence of the U.S. dollar on global trade. If the share of trade invoiced in [a digital currency] were to rise, shocks in the U.S. would have less potent spillovers through exchange rates, and trade would become less synchronized across countries The dollars influence on global financial conditions could similarly decline if a financial architecture was developed around the new [digital currency] and it displaced the dollars dominance in credit markets. At first glance, its not too difficult to see some of the loopholes in Carneys proposals. For one thing, the U.S. dollar, at press time, is among the most stable currencies out there, so to suddenly want to remove it from the financial space and replace it with a new digital currency thats still in its earliest form is a little scary. Second, Carney is not suggesting anything unique. Hes merely discussing the probability of replacing one currency with another. Getting the U.S. dollar out of its present place wont solve any problems. The same issues will simply shift over to whatever digital currency gets put in charge, considering it will still be the predominant currency at the head of the financial line. Maybe what we need to clear these concerns is to have multiple currencies stored away, not just the U.S. dollar, so that countries can continue to do business with each other should a global market collapse occur.

The currency continues to sink following a nasty fall that saw it lose more than $600 in less than an hour just a few days ago, yet there are those who refuse to acknowledge bitcoin is anything less than perfect. Among these men is David Wachsman. Wachsman founded a company that shares his last name. This company is a global blockchain services firm, and hes confident that despite bitcoins present trading price, the currency has not reached its end. He feels its blockchain is as powerful as ever, and the currency is on the brink of what hes calling a solid revival. In an interview, he states: Were seeing a revival of bitcoin. It is the oldest blockchain and is in many ways, one of the slowest blockchains. The one that has certainly had its challenges in terms of upgrades, but bitcoin is experiencing an enormous social revival in our industry. It is amazing. Bitcoin is reliable, and that reliability has turned out to be something incredibly sexy. One of the reasons he says bitcoin will always remain popular is because people trust it. Many of the new tokens, he claims, are frowned upon by long-term cryptocurrency enthusiasts, who fail to see their prowess or acknowledge their benefits. He explains: It is the tortoise and the hare story. The tortoise, which is bitcoin, seems to be racing ahead of the hare, which is all these other blockchains for the moment. As people look at how crypto has evolved thus far, they, unfortunately, see that there are not a lot of use cases that are at work today. We dont have a lot of consumer grade products right now. Today, you can rarely use crypto outside of payments. Thats what it comes down to, and bitcoin works well as a payment method. Theres never been a transaction to my knowledge thats ever been interrupted. Its not really possible. Many newcomers came crawling towards bitcoin in 2017 when its price was the most bullish. He claims that for the most part, people have seemingly lost interest in the coin and what it can do, but hes certain this is about to change. He says: As for the people who have always been interested in the industry and the technology, I dont know any who are not interested in bitcoin, so the average person in the blockchain or crypto space likes bitcoin more just because they have always like bitcoin. The new people who have come on, who really get the technology  who understand the power of the blockchain  all of them in some way, shape or form respect bitcoin.

While this is still miles better than where it was during this same time last year, the price is droopy when compared to the $10,200 bitcoin stood at early in the week. Of course, this isnt stopping many analysts  including Mike Novogratz  from staying bullish. Mike Novogratz is the chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings, a crypto investment company. He says that while the bitcoin and cryptocurrency revolution is going to happen, he makes it clear in an interview that enthusiasts still need to give these assets time to recover from what happened in 2017 and 2018, the years that bitcoin rose then fell exponentially. He comments: What 2017 did, that crazy bull market, is it got people unrealistic expectations on how fast the blockchain revolution, the crypto revolution is actually going to happen. You got to give them some more runway before we give them the thumbs up or thumbs down. Novogratz believes it could be at least five more years before cryptocurrencies really start to impact peoples lives. In other words, it will be the year 2024 before bitcoin and its altcoin cousins really have serious marks on the finance industry. While the revolution has certainly been kicked off through companies such as Facebook (with its new cryptocurrency Libra) and Apple, things will still occur at a slow and gradual pace. For the most part, Novogratz believes Libra really got things moving in the crypto industry this year, though hes confident traditional financial firms will eventually step up to the plate and trigger the next bull market run. He states: I think [the next bitcoin bull run will happen] when institutions start coming in. Theyre slowly and steadily moving in This is not like a backwater experiment anymore. This is part of the financial infrastructure. Its time for the regulators to catch up. Regulation has been the other serious plot point of bitcoins story this year. It can be argued that Libra sparked this debate as well, though one could also say that regulation would have come regardless. In any case, many members of U.S. Congress didnt take too kindly to the notion of Facebook collecting peoples private financial data and decided to get more involved. In addition, the currency has sparked concern from world leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who commented that while Libra should be examined with an open mind, it should not be privy to any special treatment. Per Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of London exchange Luno, says many people are still speculating over the BTC price, which means a revolution could be farther away than even Novogratz suggests.

Singh says that he works regularly with all these companies that put millions of dollars into their advertising campaigns, whereas all theyd have to do to garner customers is accept bitcoin. Hes confident the tech community is becoming more interested in the cryptocurrency and is eager for opportunities to work with it, but that these companies simply arent catching on. He claims: I talk to cool, hip tech brands who are spending all this money on marketing right now. All they need to do is accept bitcoin to get new customers. The whole crypto community, which has been valued as high as $800 billion, would know about these brands. [They] would probably be doing about five to ten percent of their online sales in bitcoin, and of that five to ten percent, nearly 60 percent of those customers will be first-time customers. Unfortunately, accepting bitcoin  or any cryptocurrency as a means of payment  is still subject to many rules and speculation, and so long as volatility exists, many of these companies are not going to examine bitcoin or view it as a reasonable form of money. He says: It boggles my mind when I talk to these mid-tier brands and they dont even know about [bitcoin]. These are cool tech kids that are running these companies, backed by VCs, and they dont even understand how bitcoin works. He says that major tech companies like Microsoft, New Egg, ATT and Dish Network all accept crypto payments, but that very few small Silicon Valley startups do, which he believes is a big mistake: I get snail mail every day from new startups trying to get me to buy their sleeping mattresses or eyeglasses when they could increase their sales dramatically by accepting bitcoin. Theyll say theyre too busy or that they cant hold bitcoin on their balance sheet, and we tell them they dont have to. They can settle in U.S. dollars the next day. It is still not interesting to them. Theyre going to get [potentially millions] in new revenue per year. Do they care about that? Still, they say its not a fit for them right now or theyre too busy. The good news is that not all companies are taking this route. According to Singh, Bit Pay processed more than $1 billion in BTC transactions in 2018, beating out its 2017 record. In addition, roughly 53 percent of these transactions occurred at the hands of new customers. ","['bitcoin', 'BitPay', 'Sonny Singh']"

Why, when it drops, does it have to do so in such grandiose fashion? The granddaddy of cryptocurrency fell by more than $600 in less than 30 minutes yesterday, dropping from about $10,200 to about $9,600. Unfortunately, things havent quite stopped there. Today, the currency is down by another $200, having fallen into the high $9,400s. The bad news is that bitcoins behavior seems to be rubbing off on all its altcoin cousins. At press time, many competitors to bitcoin  including Ethereum, Litecoin, bitcoin cash, EOS and Ripples XRP  are down for the count as well, with Ethereum trading in the low $170 range. Many of these coins have lost anywhere between five and 11 percent within the last 24 hours. The news has got many analysts in a twist, wondering what the heck could have happened and what might have prompted bitcoin to fall so quickly from grace. Several industry experts agree that it was some sort of mass cash out, with hodlers selling some of their stashes off to purchase new bitcoin futures set to emerge this coming Friday. Dave Balter, chief executive of Flipside Crypto Inc. in Boston, comments: From our end, it looks like it was a sell-off to cash settle futures that are coming due on Friday for BTC. Jeff Dorman, chief executive at Arca, explains that a lot of cryptocurrency is just sitting there in peoples accounts doing nothing, which means that even the slightest above normal transaction is likely to push crypto over the edge. He states: Its the week before Labor Day. Half of crypto is at Burning Man and the other half is sitting on their hands doing nothing. Volumes are low, and it takes very little to move markets right now, and you have big futures/ options expirations coming up at the end of the week. The only definitive thing I can point to is that the move was led by declines in EOS, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC and other large-cap tokens that have been out of favor for months. I just dont think there are a lot of investors willing to defend price right now. This is interesting in the sense that Dorman believes bitcoin is dropping because altcoins are dropping, not the other way around. According to one source, market cap isnt a solid factor to determine the overall health of coin. One could purchase an asset when its trading at $100, but then do nothing with it as it jumps beyond the $1,000 mark. Realized capitalization, it suggests, is a far more accurate measure of determining how stable a coin is given that the asset is measured when its moved around.

In many ways, the currencys volatility has stopped us from doing all we can with it. According to Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of the Luno exchange in London, the idea is to spend bitcoin Not just sit on it. Otherwise, we probably wont ever see the cryptocurrency rise through the ranks to compete with the likes of fiat and credit cards. In a recent interview, Swanepoel says that bitcoin, like all forms of crypto, are ultimately designed to be spent like USD or any other type of traditional currency. The problem is that many people still only see it as a potential investment and not as a spending option, and until this changes advancement for bitcoin will never become a solid reality. He comments: Theres a split [in how people are using bitcoin]. With bitcoin, theres a lot of complexity with whos doing what. Theres not always as much visibility on the market as wed all like to have. Roughly about 90 percent [of bitcoin buyers] I would put into the category of investments slash speculations, so it could be people who have a long-term view on it, people who like to trade it, and about ten percent would be transactions. This makes a lot of sense when one considers bitcoins behavior as soon as whales engage in exchange action. Recently, whales  individuals who hold large amounts of a specific type of cryptocurrency  were alleged to have moved several million dollars-worth of bitcoin between exchange addresses, which many believe led to the cryptocurrencys volatility late last week. The price went up and down, and all the while, people took notice of the mass amounts of money being moved from one exchange to another. This is probably not something bitcoin is used to. Maneuvers such as these count as transactions, and if bitcoin is used to just sitting there and being looked at by those who hope it expands in price, its probably going to exhibit a few harsh reactions. Swanepoel believes that the heaviest bitcoin action is stemming from China-based traders. He mentions: [China has] always been a big source of liquidity for bitcoin and price support. Theres a lot of people who are still using bitcoin in China, though perhaps not on Chinese platforms. Theres a strong retail trading base in China. People like to trade assets there. At the same time, he does acknowledge how many regions are stepping up to the plate and competing with Chinas dominance in the crypto space: Theres a lot more people now using bitcoin in the U.S., in Europe, in Africa and in Southeast Asia.

Yes, bitcoin has been undergoing some serious volatility over the past week or two, but its usually whats happening behind specific doors that mark how popular a cryptocurrency is, and in examining the world of bitcoin CME futures trading, one can only assume that the currencys status in the financial system is spiking quickly. A new report submitted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group shows that bitcoin futures trading in 2019 is at an all-time high. Interest in the coin is significantly up when compared to how it was last August, and further rises are expected over the coming weeks. Bitcoin has been on a roll since April of this year when it broke the $5,000 line for the first time in several months. Prior to that, bitcoin had spent the last five months in the gutter and trading for approximately $3,500  roughly 70 percent less than where it had been during the first half of 2018. This has likely caused the currencys popularity to stir, which in turn leads to higher trading and stronger products. CME Group managing director and global head of equity products and alternative investments Tim McCourt commented: Year-to-date, bitcoin futures are averaging 7,237 contracts per day, which is a 132 percent increase from the same period last year This is an exciting time for bitcoin futures, as well as for cryptocurrency assets in general. There is a lot of broad investor interest in cryptocurrency, as well as growing interest in a variety of applications for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. It will be interesting to see how this new market continues to grow and scale. For us at CME Group, a major focus is education, and making sure our customers have all the tools they need to make solid strategic decisions around crypto. CME is unique in the sense that its stuck around. In other words, it hasnt let certain economic issues weigh it down. The company began launching bitcoin futures in December 2017, around the same time that bitcoin reached its all-time high of nearly $20,000. From there, however, we all remember what happened Bitcoin began sinking deeper and deeper into oblivion, and before long, many companies offering bitcoin products were certain they had made a mistake. CBOE, for example, discontinued its bitcoin futures program by the time 2019 rolled around, but CME weathered the storm and decided that these contracts were inherently worth providing. Clearly, the decision has paid off. McCourt states: Our role is to help bitcoin market participants manage their risk, regardless of whether the underlying price goes up or down. Were pleased with the growth of CME Group bitcoin futures so far. ","['bitcoin', 'Bitcoin Futures', 'CBoe', 'cme']"

Many experts seem to agree that this is the case for Craig Wright, an Australian bitcoin technologist who is allegedly the man behind the currencys creation. Wright recently lost a serious lawsuit that will force him to forfeit half of his bitcoin earnings prior to January 2014, along with other interests, to Ira Kleiman, the brother of the now deceased Dave Kleiman. Dave, who served as one of Wrights core developers, passed away in April of 2013, and Ira claims that Wright has worked hard to make off with his brothers rightful bitcoin earnings. This has led to a massive court case that began in 2018 and concluded roughly 24 hours ago after a Florida judge decided that Wright should hand over 50 percent of the bitcoins he mined prior to the start of 2014. If what Wright has mentioned all this time is correct, there could possibly be about five billion bitcoin units that Ira is entitled to. Of course, Wright and his legal team have the right to appeal the final ruling, though the judges decision cannot be opposed. Following the cases final points, the Australian made a doomsday announcement to the bitcoin community claiming that billions of BTC units will soon flood the market, which could potentially cause a serious downgrade in the cryptocurrencys price. Many industry experts, however, are either choosing to ignore Wrights verbiage or are taking it with a grain of salt. Wright stirred controversy in 2018 when he claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the man who allegedly created bitcoin. Many enthusiasts find these words hard to believe, and some claim that Wright has no access to the bitcoin holdings he claims to possess. Ryan Selkis, for example, is the chief executive officer at the crypto research firm Messari Inc. He doesnt believe anything Wright says, and claims: Im not worried about Craig transferring bitcoin to Kleinman because I dont think he has any to transfer. Its a sideshow, not a real story. The real Satoshi Nakamoto allegedly has control of over one million bitcoin units in whats known as the Tulip Trust. Many have asked Wright to transfer funds from this trust to prove hes the real Nakamoto, though Wright has refused these requests time and time again. Devin Freeman, a legal representative for Ira Kleiman, comments: The Kleiman family has waited a long time to recover assets that should have been returned to it shortly after Daves unfortunate death in 2013. While Wright (thus far) doesnt appear to be rejecting the courts decision, he did jokingly mention that if Ira wants the bitcoins so bad, hell now be privy to heavy estate taxes.

You must know when to invest, and more importantly, how much. Investing a little or a lot can make all the difference in your financial future. Luckily for Erik Finman, he knew exactly what to do (and when) to become the worlds youngest bitcoin millionaire. Finman received a $1,000 check from his grandmother at age 12. He didnt know what to do with it at first but decided to make a deal with his parents: if he could turn that money into $1 million before he reached adulthood, he wouldnt have to attend a university or college. Finman was never a fan of school; in fact, he wound up dropping out of high school to turn his attention to bitcoin and cryptocurrency ventures full time once his investments began showing promise. Still, his path towards those millions were somewhat risky. At around the time he received the money from his grandma, bitcoin was trading for about $10 per unit. He wound up buying roughly 1,000 bitcoins and has since continued to invest his money in the cryptocurrency. Today, he owns nearly 450 units, amounting to approximately $4.5 million. In an interview, Finman reveals how he came across bitcoin. It was at a protest he attended with his older brother following the financial crisis of 2008. The protest got out of hand, which ultimately saw Finman, his brother all their associates running from the police. In all the commotion, Finman came across a man with a bitcoin logo on his shirt and asked what it was all about. He explains: Hes like a hippie. Hes like, Man, I think its going to end Wall Street. All the corruption and all the bad things. This got Finman interested and he began researching the coin on his own time to find out more. It was then that he decided where he was going to put the money hed received. From then on, he spent virtually everyday trading more and adding to his growing stash. By the time he was 15, he was engaged in trades of $100,000 or more. It was at this time when he dropped out of school and founded an education startup known as Botangle, which pairs students looking to learn online with teachers. He later sold this business for roughly 300 bitcoins, only to buy it back later claiming that he loved the name so much. By the time June 2017 rolled along, Finman was 18 years old. The cryptocurrency reached $2,700, which pushed him into the millionaire status. He had won his bet with his parents and was not made to attend further schooling. He is now a 20-year-old Silicon Valley executive running a new bitcoin trading tool known as Coin Bits. ","['bitcoin', 'Botangle', 'Erik Finman']"

The Cambridge Analytica affair to strike the tech world in 2018 left many people reeling, and trust in the social media conglomerate fell to all-time lows. As it turned out, Facebook had been selling peoples private data to third parties for advertising purposes. The idea that ones private information  i.e. their birthdate, their location, etc.  is that vulnerable to outside snoopers is a little scary, though despite the potential concerns that are floating around about Libra and Facebooks crypto plans, Gelsinger seems to be pointing the finger at bitcoin. Maybe Gelsinger is looking for attention. After all, VMware is about to host its annual San Francisco conference, so maybe he thinks putting down an asset thats hot right now will bring him and his company some attention. Who knows? Bitcoin has been trapped in a state of light volatility over these past few weeks, but its still doing miles better than where it was in 2018 and has been on the rise since last April. He further states: The customers of my products need to be GDPR compliant, and while some may say I may not be a company thats monetizing personal data, both the customers of my customers are. His specific complaints regarding bitcoin are that it is often used for illicit activity, and that it contributes to the ongoing climate crisis thanks to the amount of energy it uses. He mentions: It takes the energy of a home, half-a-home a day, to do a single entry into a bitcoin ledger. Its climate intolerant, it is so extreme. It is a bad design. Bitcoin requires several servers, computers and cooling machines to extract new coins. Still, Gelsingers comments arent likely to fly with everyone, considering there are several people that see bitcoin as digital gold. He concludes with: We dont get to be absent from the policy and social debates. We have to be an active participant in them in shaping technology to be good. ","['bitcoin', 'Libra', 'Pat Gelsinger']"

This, in many ways, has helped retail players get ahead in the field of cryptocurrency, according to the Winklevoss Twins of The Social Network fame. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, known primarily as the allegedly real creators of Facebook, have been two of the biggest bitcoin and crypto advocates the world has ever seen. The pair founded the Gemini Exchange in New York and were one of the first teams to acquire the infamous BitLicense, which is required if a crypto or blockchain company wants to operate or offer its services in the city that doesnt sleep. Now, both men have expressed interest in joining the board of Facebooks Libra, a new digital currency thats set for global standards. Libra was first announced earlier this year and has been met with mixed reactions. The currencys creators  including David Marcus, formerly of PayPal  have been subjected to harsh scrutiny from U.S. regulators and lawmakers, who seek to understand what Libra is planning to do with the customer information it will gather. Facebook was in major trouble in April of 2018 when its partnership with Cambridge Analytica was revealed. The social media platform had been selling customers private data to third parties for advertising purposes. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the company, was grilled by Senate members in what ultimately amounted to a fine of a few billion dollars initiated just a month ago. Some believe that Facebook got away with a simple slap on the wrist, but Libras development has since been put on hold. While its unclear if Libra will ever get back on track, the currency is now in a period of stagnation, which is likely to last until the U.S. congress gets all the answers its looking for. In the meantime, the Winklevoss Twins are commenting that retail players have made the 2019 bitcoin price what it is. While the currency ultimately collapsed at the end of 2018, bitcoin began jumping up again in April of this year after several new tech companies potentially began showing interest in crypto. In an interview, Tyler and Cameron explain: Unlike the internet, which you couldnt buy a piece of, you can actually buy a piece of this new internet money. Its still a retail-drive market from day one, and a lot of people have done well. Wall Street has been asleep at the wheel. Interestingly, the Twins ultimately saw themselves getting into crypto thanks to FOMO (fear of missing out). They saw bitcoin as the future of money, claiming: We had to invest because we were afraid of missing out. We couldnt miss out on the future. ","['bitcoin', 'Libra', 'winklevoss twins']"

This is about $300 higher than where it stood over the weekend, and its all thanks  according to one source  to recent tweets submitted by President Donald Trump regarding the U.S.s trade war with China. The trade conflict has been going on for some time now, and right in the middle of all the action has been bitcoin. Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down. A few weeks ago, bitcoin was trading in the high $11,000 range given that many were concerned about the stock market and other significant signs that the countrys financial system wasnt doing well. Many saw bitcoins as digital gold; a safe haven that could potentially preserve wealth in the event of economic disaster. While nothing like that occurred, fear was running rampant throughout the space. The price inherently went up while stocks and other traditional market tools went down. Unfortunately, those fears ultimately kicked the bucket, and bitcoin began easing back down into the $10,000 and $9,000 range. While its moved up somewhat, theres still plenty of room for growth. Now, bitcoin is trading higher given that Donald Trump says he feels regret surrounding the trade war. He doesnt regret initiating it; rather, hes regretful that he didnt start it sooner, and he wishes he had enforced larger tariffs. The playing field is still open for both sides, and Trumps new tariffs on approximately $300 billion new imports from China are slated to begin in September of this year. Nigel Green, the chief executive of the financial consultancy firm deVere Group, explained in an interview: Escalating tensions between the two worlds largest economies will see investors pile in to decentralized, non-sovereign and secure currencies, such as bitcoin, to protect them from the turmoil taking place in traditional markets. Green later commented that users can expect to see the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies spike heavily in the coming weeks. The real fuel to the fire came from Donald Trumps recent messages, which say that China has long taken advantage of America. Hes looking to prevent that from happening in the future, stating: Sadly, past administrations have allowed China to get so far ahead of fair and balanced trade that it has become a great burden to the American taxpayer. I can no longer allow this to happen. In the spirit of achieving fair trade, we must balance this very unfair trading relationship. Market analyst and crypto investor Alex Kruger noted the significance of bitcoins sudden burst, explaining: Today was the first time that bitcoin reacted sharply in real-time to a trade war breaking headline. As far as I can recall, this is the first time that bitcoin reacts in real-time to any event outside crypto. ","['bitcoin', 'Donald Trump', 'trade war']"

Users will now have the option to trade, buy and sell the worlds second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Bit Flyer has been predominantly focused on bitcoin. No other currency has been available through the exchange, which for the most part, has been a mistake on the exchanges side. While bitcoin is still the largest cryptocurrency and dominates most of the space, competitors like Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin and EOS have garnered heavy followings over the years, so to deny these currencies their space in the industry would undoubtedly lead to problems for both the exchange and its customers in the future. Bit Flyer is still relatively new, having only come to fruition about two years ago. Thus, its likely that the exchange merely took this time to test out its services and abilities through bitcoin. Now that the platform is getting its feet off the ground, adding Ethereum  the primary competitor to bitcoin  seems like the next viable step. The exchange has also commented that it is targeting both experienced traders and beginners, so long as they have an inherent interest and love for cryptocurrency. Andy Bryant, the co-head and COO of the organizations Europe division, explains in a statement: At Bit Flyer, we want to offer not just the most popular coins, but the most respected ones too, which makes ETH a logical choice to expand our service offering. Not only has ETH proved itself as a useful altcoin, particularly in relation to smart contracts, it has an incredibly strong community that surrounds it. Were committed to offering the best customer experience whilst prioritizing security and regulatory standards, and were proud to say buy/ sell now offers this capability with ETH. Bit Flyer ultimately launched its America-based organization back in November 2017, roughly one month before bitcoin reached its all-time high of nearly $20,000 per unit. The European division of the company launched two months later in January of 2018. The company also became one of the first to obtain the infamous BitLicense, which is required granted a crypto company wants to operate or offer its services in New York. Hailey Lennon, head of legal and regulatory affairs at Bit Flyer USA, commented on the growth of regulation in the crypto space, stating: As crypto regulation is evolving, we work to ensure that everything listed on our exchange complies with the global regulatory standards. Were excited for todays announcement, adding ether to our growing portfolio of coins with NYDFS approval, and were looking forward to launching more coins in the coming months.

Emilio Testa, 32 years old, was sentenced last Thursday and will also serve a year of probation following the cease of his prison term. Testa originally began dealing in bitcoin back in 2016, claiming he wasnt a fan of banks or dealing with taxes. He began converting all his fiat into BTC units but wound up communicating with two undercover agents who recorded all his online maneuvers. In March of last year, Testa ultimately wound up converting some of his bitcoin proceeds from black market drug sales into fiat money. A second transaction of this nature occurred two months later in May 2018. Following his arrest and apprehension by Colorado police, Testa claimed guilt in the crimes following the introduction of a plea deal with federal authorities. U.S. Attorney Jason Dunn explained in a statement: Trying to hide criminal proceeds in bitcoin? Were going to find you. Working in tandem with our federal partners, our prosecutors are leading the fight against cryptocurrency crimes. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) ultimately took over the case, according to a press release. Steven Cagen, a special agent presiding over the case with HSI Denver, stated: Criminals may be sophisticated enough to use cryptocurrency, but theyre not smart enough to stay out of jail, as this conviction shows. Our agents will continue to shine a light on criminals who use the dark web and bitcoin to try and conceal their illegal activity. Crypto crime is still a huge business, though for the most part, its unusual for someone like Testa to be working alone. Most cases involving cryptocurrency ultimately include several parties or an entire ring of criminals working together to steal as many millions as they can. In other cases, the crimes can take on more white-collar facades in that they involve companies putting on a phony disguise. They promise big returns to all their investors, and usually wind up laundering the money or spending it all when nobodys looking. Several authorities warn that if an investing opportunity appears too good to be true, it probably is. One such situation arose in Dallas, Texas earlier this month. The company, known as Forex and Bitcoin Trader, was offering traders returns of roughly 900 percent within weeks of their initial investments. 900 percent is huge regardless of the time in question, so to offer such a large amount that quickly set Texas regulators off the handle. They immediately sent the company a cease-and-desist letter, claiming that if they didnt stop with the phony promises, theyd face legal consequences.

As of late, cryptocurrency has been growing in terms of how its being used. Originally, all cryptocurrencies were designed to replace fiat money and plastic credit cards, but their volatility ultimately got in the way. Price swings have inherently caused retailers and merchandise providers to reject bitcoin and its altcoin cousins as means of payment, and we can see why. If a person buys $50 worth of merchandise with BTC, for example, but tomorrow the price of the currency goes down, theyll still walk away with the items they purchased. The company they bought from, however, loses out. Its not entirely fair for the receiving party, which is why we havent seen that many companies welcome BTC and other cryptocurrencies with open arms. Now and then, we see a company like Overstock.com do so. Overstock was the first company to begin accepting bitcoin payments for goods and services in 2014. Since then, platforms like Flexa have emerged to pave the way for other companies to follow in the retailers footsteps. Flexa currently works with companies like Nordstrom, Jamba Juice and Whole Foods to make it easier for them to accept crypto payments. The Mavericks are not the first NBA team to accept crypto. This honor falls on the Sacramento Kings, which began accepting BTC payments in 2014, but its good to see the trend continue. The team has entered into a partnership with Bit Pay to process transactions for all customers looking to make purchases with crypto. Bit Pay CEO Stephen Pair explains in a statement: The Dallas Mavericks have been an outspoken advocate for bitcoin, opening up opportunities for the team as it starts to accept bitcoin for ticket sales and merchandise. Interestingly, the Dallas Mavericks are owned by billionaire investor Mark Cuban, who in the past, hasnt been particularly fond of cryptocurrencies. In an interview, Cuban states: We want our fans who would like to pay with Bitcoin to have the opportunity to do so. Bit Pay allows our global fans to seamlessly make purchases with the Mavs. While Cuban has never been openly against bitcoin, he has expressed great disdain for cryptocurrencies like Libra in the past. Hes commented: Im not a big fan of what theyre doing there. I think its a big mistake Globally and in countries where there isnt a lot of rule of law, or a lot of government stability or currency stability, then it could be dangerous. Cuban likely realizes that while he may not like crypto, there are a lot of people who do, and opening the door for them is only a path towards further revenue.

Its being reported that several whales moved millions of dollars of bitcoin between three unknown wallet addresses. The total in question comes to about 77,000 bitcoins. Thats just shy of $800 million, or about 0.43 percent of the bitcoins in circulation. Later in the day, Ripple whales moved more than 484 million units of XRP  Ripples official cryptocurrency  into separate wallets. In all, the total XRP moved around was more than $130 million. Whales are individuals that hold mass amounts of a specific cryptocurrency. It is widely speculated that these figures hold most of whats already been mined, in this case bitcoin and XRP. If they move funds around, were likely to see heavy movement  usually dips  in the crypto space. As of late, bitcoin has been jumping between $10,000 and $10,300. While this movement correlates with the actions of the whales in question, its odd to see that the drops have been so light in comparison to what theyve been in the past. One would think that if whales are moving mass amounts of money throughout different wallets and accounts, the dips in price would be even larger. This leads to even more questions, one being, What if this is just the beginning? Also, What if were likely to see even bigger dips in the bitcoin price over the next few days? The good news is that at press time, this all remains pure speculation. However, many are ringing in on social media and across other platforms with their theories and predictions regarding what the whales (or other culprits) have up their sleeves. One hypothesis is that the transactions have something to do with the Chinese Ponzi scheme Plus Token. Those behind the scheme are believed to have stolen in excess of $3 billion from global crypto users. Could the scammers possibly be cashing out their earnings? Another theory is that this is just a few exchanges moving things around, whereas if whales are indeed at fault, this could be a sign that the market is about to explode and move up significantly.  The two largest bitcoin transactions to occur involved over 33,000 BTC and 36,000 BTC respectively. In addition, they each took place within a half hour of each other. Whale Alert, a platform that reports on large crypto transactions, took to Twitter to release the following message: It is likely that the devs (developers) moved or unlocked the locked supply of the coin (total supply 100,000,000). These transactions allegedly follow another large one that took place earlier in the week. Approximately $774 million VERI (more than 97 million units) were moved from one wallet to another, though Whale Alert claims that VERI is a low-volume coin.

Well, thanks to a new Manhattan-based gym called Grit Bxng, thats exactly whats happening. Grit Bxng is a 5,000 square foot facility that cost more than $4 million to build. Its currently backed by several celebrities including the rapper Pit Bull and venture capitalist Tim Draper, who recently announced that bitcoin would reach a stellar price of roughly $250,000 per unit by early 2023. Tim Drapers presence in the gym is to be expected considering the gym is among the only ones in the United States to accept bitcoin payments. Granted youre looking for a special one-on-one session with a trainer, need to purchase meal supplements or workout gear, or youre just looking to make monthly payments on your membership, customers have the option of paying with BTC to get the job done. This is proof that bitcoin is becoming far more mainstream. Previously, companies such as Overstock.com and rural coffee houses throughout the globe were among the few select retail outlets to accept digital currency for goods and services, but now a major gym has joined the ranks. A few other perks are that if youre a trainer at Grit Bxng, you can make up to $1,000 per hour. Customers can also enjoy a special alcoholic beverage at the gyms bar following their workout. This creates something of a conundrum in that exercising is meant to get your body in shape, whereas alcohol does the opposite. Doesnt it defeat the purpose of working out to go and enjoy a cocktail or mojito after your session is over? Youve burned all those calories and worked to get yourself in tip-top shape, only to ruin it with a beverage thats likely filled to the brim with sugar and other toxins that could potentially make the previous hour of your life completely worthless. Nevertheless, some people might look at this and consider it a nice addition to what would otherwise be a standard exercise facility. Its creator, Bill Zanker  who also created the Learning Annex  says that it was his idea to create a gymnasium that offered happy hour services to its customers. Something like a gym facility combined with a chic club. He explains: No one likes to work out. Now, working out is fun. He also says that people from all over the world  from London to Tel Aviv in Israel  flew out to interview for jobs as trainers with the facility. About two of these trainers make $1,000 an hour, while the rest make  on average  about $450 an hour. He comments: We had trainers fly in to try out. We really have the best trainers in the world.

At press time, the currency has fallen roughly $200 since yesterday afternoon, and is now trading for less than $10,150. And yet, there are many analysts out there that seem to believe the bulls arent quite done yet. Some suggest that an entirely new bull run is about to enter the crypto market, and bitcoin is going to surge beyond our wildest dreams. So, why do they think this? Whats making them believe that bitcoin is not done surging, and what evidence do they have that serves their hypotheses? While we may not be able to see it, Hans Hauge  a senior qualitative researcher for the crypto investment firm Ikigai  says that bitcoin is behaving in a way similar with this time of year during 2017, just months before it exploded to roughly $20,000 per unit. In a series of Twitter posts, Hauge explains: Our current level of reserve risk is equivalent to where we were in the early part of 2017. That was right before things got crazy and six to nine months before the bubble burst. Bitcoin was around $1,000 to $2,000 at the time. Bitcoin bubble tops are clearly identified with a dark red cluster of adjusted binary bitcoin days destroyed. Until that happens, were not at the top. Public opinion is key here because that red cluster is caused by the assumption of the crowd and is self-fulfilling. Hauge went on to say that crypto-based fear and greed indexes are considerably low, thus paving the way for further spikes. Bitcoin is based on speculation, and so long as its audience believes in it, it has a chance of doing well. He explains: [The Bitcoin] Crypto Fear and Greed [Index] is printing all-time lows. Thats the exact thing you should be looking for if youre buying the dip for the long-term. Its unknown where bitcoin will go in the immediate future, though for the most part, this bullish sentiment seems to be striking analysts from every corner of the space. Venture capitalist Tim Draper, for example, has long proposed that bitcoin will spike to more than $250,000 by the year 2022, though hes recently pushed his prediction back a few months. In addition, men like Tom Lee of Fundstrat fame are still predicting massive moves for bitcoin by the end of the year. Considering were about to enter September and there are only four months left before 2020 shows its face, its hard to fully believe that bitcoin could maneuver itself into such high territory (i.e. $40,000 per coin) in so short a period, though thats precisely what it did in 2017  spiking from $5,000 in September to just under $20,000 by Christmas.

The case marks the first time a plant like this has been compromised in the name of cryptocurrency. Usually, hackers are known for targeting either cryptocurrency exchanges, trading platforms, individual wallets and even government agencies. This time, however, nuclear power is the victim in question. During a raid on the plant, two bitcoin mining rigs were seized from an administrative wing, as well as network and fiber-optic cables. The situation is particularly dangerous in that the mining could have potentially triggered something to go wrong in the plants operations, which could have led to serious problems including a meltdown. That very same day, a National Guard of Ukraine found additional mining equipment within the plant including several hard drives and GPU video cards. They also found routers and two solid-state drives. All these items and more were discovered within the barracks of the guards that were tasked with watching over the plant. Thus, its believed that those employed to work within the plant may be responsible for the hack. While nobody was hurt due to the event, it appears classified information regarding the plants protection system may have fallen into the wrong hands. At press time, its unclear if the information was delivered purposely or who may have access to it. Its also unclear if the data was, in fact, compromised, or if perhaps just the potential to release the information was there. Nevertheless, several people are likely to be charged in connection with the incident, and authorities are unclear if the National Guard was at the center of it all. Phil Neray, vice president of industrial cybersecurity at CyberX, believes that the materials and devices uncovered during the raid were likely there for many months. He believes that a trust but verify security model is necessary for businesses like these considering the amount of private and confidential information they house. He states: Even with the strictest policies and regulations in the world, its all theoretical if you arent continuously monitoring for unusual or unauthorized activity. While past cyberattacks dont compare with whats stated above, the situation is clear: security surrounding cryptocurrency and blockchain operations is not what it could be. While this didnt necessarily pertain to crypto specifically, it did involve mining rigs and the process of accessing or extracting new coins. Clearly, the security at the power plant was not strong enough and individuals in charge either had no idea that this was going on or were potentially in on it themselves. Operations like this should require necessary background checks and several additional steps to ensure those in charge of security will do their jobs well.

A hacker by the name of Grant West has taken control of several units of bitcoin that arent his and is now facing extensive prison time. This scenario is a little different, however. One of the big issues that many crypto holders have with the security of the space is that its lacking. Many times, when funds are stolen or go missing, they are often never recovered. The case at hand has the hacker being told by a judge to compensate all his victims and pay back what he has taken or else he can look forward to an additional four years in prison. The 27-year-old hacker was previously described as a one-man cybercrime wave. After he was arrested in 2017, he was sentenced to serve time in jail for his misdeeds. A judge is now ordering him to pay back roughly 900,000 pounds in BTC. Thats over $1 million in USD. The interesting fact about this case is that those 900,000 pounds are more than what was originally taken. The reason the judge is ordering more is because bitcoin, at press time, is higher than where it stood in September of two years ago, and the court seeks to ensure all victims are compensated appropriately. Police authorities had been in possession of roughly 82 BTC units since West was imprisoned. It is estimated that each bitcoin will be worth around 8,500 pounds each at the time of dispersal. Prosecuting counsel Kevin Barry explains: Inevitably, in any case like this, there will have to be a further hearing after this. As the court recognizes today, as do the parties, there is likely to be fluctuation which will require in due course for the order to be amended upwards or downwards. While authorities possessed the stolen bitcoins long after Wests arrest, they are not legally able to provide the bitcoins to anyone unless the defendant agrees. In this case, the answer was obvious: repay your victims or face an additional four years in prison, though the option remained open for West not to part with the bitcoins. DCI Kirsty Goldsmith, who heads the Mets cybercrime unit, explained in a statement: The MPS is committed to ensuring that individuals who are committing criminality on the dark web are identified, prosecuted and their criminal assets are seized I am very proud of my team for bringing this offender to justice and ensuring we have secured this order. Wests criminal career began in 2015. He would ultimately spend over two years committing cyberattacks on several companies around the world including Sainsburys, Uber and the British Cardiovascular Society. He was sentenced to nearly 11 years in prison for his actions in May of 2018. ","['Bitcoins', 'cyberattack', 'Grant West', 'hacker']"

Thats what venture capitalist Spencer Bogart is telling everyone. Hes saying that any severe financial crisis would ultimately cause bitcoin to plunge back into a period of extreme darkness that would make 2018 look subtle. While hes certain that bitcoin will be a safe haven in the future, hes not entirely sure its technology is strong enough yet for it to withstand a series of economic hits similar with what the country experienced in 2008. Hes confident that should a recession strike the United States, bitcoin and crypto would suffer exponentially. In a recent interview, he comments: When you think about really severe crises taking place, a liquidity crunch, another global financial crisis, I think that bitcoin will struggle to do very well from a price perspective. 11 years ago, when the economy in America really began taking a serious downturn  people were losing their homes and their jobs and their 401Ks, businesses were closing their doors permanently, etc.  bitcoin didnt yet exist. It was still in its early development stages and wasnt quite ready for speculation or investors. Now, things are very different. Bitcoin is playing with the big boys, and along with stocks and bonds, is vulnerable to the same market trends. When the Great Recession occurred, one of the first things to occur was that stocks fell dramatically, and it is likely bitcoin would experience the same drop. At press time, there appears to be great concern in the air that the U.S.-China trade war is about to take the global economy places its never been. The U.S. recently announced that it would enforce further tariffs on another $300 billion-worth of merchandise from China, while the eastern country has vowed to retaliate and is now placing billions of dollars of tariffs on U.S. imports. It seems like both sides are trying to play each other, and bitcoins likely to get caught in the middle if they cant come to an agreement. In addition, President Trump is now pressuring the Fed to cut interest rates for the first time in several years. Bogart goes on to say he doesnt believe an economic collapse will occur in the immediate future. Discussing bitcoin further, he states: As it grows up, we see bitcoin kind of evolving as it goes. So, I think right now it is kind of in this intermediate state where you really must think what the risks are and how severe they are. So, I think that when you have looming risks of monetary devaluation, things like this, bitcoin certainly looks very attractive, and I think that was a larger driver of the recent run-up in price. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading for just shy of $10,400. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Spencer Bogart', 'trade war']"

Many enthusiasts will likely remember that Overstock.com, a massive online retailer, was one of the first selling platforms to accept bitcoin as a means of payment from its customers. Byrne, himself, has been a major bitcoin advocate over the years. In a letter to shareholders, Byrne explained that while he is sad to leave the company he has worked with and respected for so long, he believes this is the right move for the country. Byrne says that his involvement in an FBI investigation regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election is what led to his decision. The letter reads: In July, I came forward to a small set of journalists regarding my involvement in certain government matters. Doing so was not my first choice, but I was reminded of the damage done to our nation for three years and felt my duty as a citizen precluded me from staying silent any longer, so I came forward in as carefully and well-managed fashion as I could. The news that I shared is bubbling (however haphazardly) into the public. Though patriotic Americans are writing me in support, my presence may affect and complicate all manner of business relationships, from insurability to strategic discussions regarding our retail business. Thus, while I believe that I did what was necessary for the good of the country, for the good of the firm, I am in the sad position of having to sever ties with Overstock, both as CEO and board member, effective Thursday August 22. It appears Byrne had been in a relationship with a Russian agent named Maria Butina since 2015. Hes confident that the company will remain strong without him, and that blockchain will ultimately carve out a future in which financial freedom is available to every citizen. He states: I think the blockchain revolution will reshape key social institutions. We have designed and breathed life into perhaps the most significant blockchain keiretsu in the world, a network of blockchain firms seeking to revolutionize identity, land governance (=rule of law=potential=capital), central banking, capital markets, supply chains and voting. In three of those fields (land governance, central banking and capital markets), the word trillions comes up when calculating the disruptive opportunity of blockchain. In closing, Byrne tells the companys shareholders what an honor it has been to serve them. He comments that it was initially his Rabbi that convinced him to come forward, and that after seeing his country tear itself apart over the past three years, he felt he could not remain uninvolved. He finishes his letter with: I wish all shareholders a smooth and level road, and dont forget to shop Overstock.com. ","['bitcoin', 'Overstock.com', 'Patrick Byrne', 'russia']"

While some people still look at them as volatile and untrustworthy, many analysts familiar with the space say theyre less noisy than traditional assets. In other words, they cause less of a raucous, and behave in far less strenuous ways. One such analyst is John Bollinger. As an author, trader and the developer of Bollinger Bands  special charting indicators for stocks  he says he first got involved in the crypto space about three years ago, seeing how much room for growth there was when it came to altcoins and its parent currency bitcoin. In an interview, he states: In the beginning, I was actually early in the game. A couple of friends of mine were early miners and I watched with interest but didnt get involved. Then I was watching the price action of bitcoin and it was behaving very much like stocks used to do a very long time ago before we got all this arbitrage and program trading and algorithmic trading. I thought that would make bitcoin a pretty ideal vehicle for trading with technical analysis tools. One of the ways analysts can better understand where cryptocurrencies will move in the future is by examining technical information from charts. Bollinger first invented the Bollinger Bands back in the 1980s to examine traditional markets. The purpose of these bands was to analyze what can now be referred to as old indicators. In other words, stocks and bonds have been around for some time, and can thus be considered older forms of investing. Whats surprising, however, is that these bands can also be applied to bitcoin. Bollinger claims that bitcoin, in many ways, operates in the exact same way as traditional stocks, and can thus be examined using the same band charts he developed more than 30 years ago. In the long run, Bollinger says that bitcoin is acting the exact same way stocks did in the 80s. He comments: I tested those ideas and it turns out thats entirely correct. Its true for all the cryptocurrencies. Thats what got me interested, because it was a vehicle that came to behave very well in relation to the classic technical analysis rules I wanted to see if there were still markets out there that behaved in the old way. Indeed, there are, and bitcoin is one. He says that while many coins remain volatile and vulnerable to price swings, many mainstream forms of crypto are still valid trading options. He claims: The list of vehicles has diminished over the past year, as some of the speculative fever has been bled out, but for the main line cryptocurrencies, the ones that are still very active I think theyre excellent technical analysis vehicles.

This is good in the sense that most use cases revolve around civilians utilizing cryptocurrency for ethical purposes. However, there do still appear to be traces of terrorist funding throughout the region. One of the big takeaways of the research is that Palestine boasts a heavy Hamas presence, yet such financing is down, and people are utilizing BTC mostly for cross-border fundraising. Awareness of crypto  particularly of BTC and Ethereum  has increased heavily over the last year, and they are mostly utilized to initiate payments to freelancers and persons working abroad. Freelance web developer Ismael Al-Safadi explains: There are some offices that now do $5 million to $6 million a month. Ive seen an office send 100 BTC in one [transaction] There are also a lot of small clients. They send $200 to $1,000. Illicit transactions are still stemming from the area, though for the most part, they are small beans when compared with those that bear appropriate legitimacy. Overall, millions of dollars in crypto payments are initiated by employers each month to workers and clients, while the illicit transactions ultimately account for only tens of thousands of dollars. In addition to crypto usage, education is growing like crazy and many residents are joining groups, clubs and similar organizations to learn more about crypto and work with others that share their passions and ideas. Al-Safadi, for example, takes part in many social media gatherings that seek to boost knowledge of crypto. He estimates there are approximately 10,000 bitcoin users just in Gaza alone. In addition, an anonymous source that teaches cryptocurrency courses and arranges meetups says that one such Facebook group centered around bitcoin boasts more than 5,000 members in the area. Another anonymous figure  a Palestinian who now calls the United Arab Emirates home  says hes using Ethereums blockchain to build a charity platform. He says the first donations will be distributed to persons in both Gaza and along the West Bank, and that the charity is built to assist under-privileged children who cant afford to attend good schools. He comments: People there [in Palestine] are starting to learn and ask about it Palestinians are more using bitcoin than ether to make international transfers and to bypass Israeli control. For the most part, however, the cryptocurrency space within the region cannot be considered legitimate enough in the sense that most crypto platforms are not connected to banks or global exchanges. Instead, most activity takes place through peer-to-peer transactions, unofficial dealers and private social media forums. In addition, most crypto users dont keep their coins but instead choose to cash out for fiat. Thus, Palestine isnt home to many hodlers. ","['bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'hamas', 'Palestine']"

Some are all for it, while others think its weird, evil, or a complete waste of time. For enthusiasts, the difficulties always come when legendary investors or businessmen attack bitcoins prospects and act like it has no merit. Today, people like Warren Buffett are joined by the ranks of Mark Mobius, a trader who founded Mobius Capital Partners last year after spending the last 30 at Franklin Templeton Investments. In a recent interview, Mobius referred to bitcoin and its crypto cousins as psycho currencies, claiming that they only spike if people believe in them enough. Hes confident that pushing bitcoin will ultimately cause other hardcore assets  like gold and precious metals  to jump in the coming months. He states: I call them psycho currencies because its a matter of faith whether you believe in bitcoin or any of the other cybercurrencies I think with the rise of [bitcoin], theres going to be a demand for real, hard assets, and that includes gold. To an extent, its a little hard to take Mobius seriously considering he switches back and forth on crypto almost at the drop of a hat. All last year, Mobius was very critical of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, claiming they were pure speculation and not worth our time or attention. Earlier this year, however, that sentiment changed somewhat. He said that digital currencies were the mark of the future, and likely to stick around for some time. Unfortunately, one can only assume that he means long enough to push gold where it needs to be based on his recent verbiage. At press time, gold has shot up in price to roughly $1,500 an ounce. This is the highest its been in several years, largely due to concerns over the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. Many see gold and similar metals as safe havens; ways to preserve ones wealth during times of economic strife. Many also viewed bitcoin this way, and several analysts found themselves labeling bitcoin virtual gold in their considerations of the cryptocurrency. Sadly, bitcoin has toppled again at the time of writing, trading for just over $10,100. This is a drop of roughly $600 over the past 24 hours. Thus, fear is entering the crypto space and the thought of gold as a potential safe haven has fallen along with its price. Mobius continued to tout the stamina of gold, claiming: Golds long-term prospect is up, up and up, and the reason why I say that is money supply is up, up and up. He comments that investors should get involved in gold regardless of the price, and points to the moves of mainstream banks, i.e. the European Central Bank, as proof that institutions are thinking the same way.

To put things specifically, it appears more tech companies and their executives want workers who are at least vaguely familiar with how blockchain operates. Many of these ventures have sought to implement bitcoin technology into their systems to manage supply chains and other elements of their businesses and want to ensure those working under their guises have at least a general understanding. This is further proof that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are becoming more mainstream. If more companies are demanding that employees have this knowledge beforehand, that means they likely consider training in the subject to be not only important, but generally available. They probably expect employees to take their time in educating themselves and seek out the proper resources before expanding their tech careers. While freelancing isnt likely to garner one the same benefits that they might find through a standard job or as a full-time employee (i.e. 401K, healthcare, etc.), approximately 73 percent of Upworks customers say they have since begun earning more as freelancers then they did through full-time jobs. Upwork Chief economist Adam Ozimek explained in a statement: This data illustrates that work of a very high skilled nature is being done by professionals on Upwork. Highly paid skills arent just anecdotes or limited to one field. They range from law to marketing to finance to high tech, and a significant percentage of U.S. freelancers earn quite high hourly wages on the platform. Per the sites data, persons working in the bitcoin field earn an average hourly wage of approximately $215 and are among the most highly paid individuals finding work through the site. Its also interesting that such knowledge remains necessary given that cryptocurrencies continue to drop left and right. Bitcoin, for example, has fallen by more than $700 since yesterday. At press time, it currently trades for approximately $10,004. Other currencies, like Ethereum, have also fallen, with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the primary competitor to bitcoin now trading for a measly $188 per unit. All crypto appears down for the count at the time of writing, though its unclear why. The best analysis that some observers have given is that the bitcoin space is being pressured by large individual orders, though this is only a possibility and unconfirmed. This would ultimately make sense, given that since bitcoin has dropped somewhat over the past day, new investors are looking to get into the industry and purchase units now while theyre down to make money in the coming weeks. Bitcoin is projected by several firms and individuals to strike new price records in 2020. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin jobs', 'bitcoin price', 'Upwork']"

BTC could either rally above $11,000 or it might slide below $10,500. This past week, bitcoin price extended its decline below the $10,500 and $10,200 supports against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair even broke the $9,800 support and settled below the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Finally, the pair tested the $9,500 support and a new monthly low was formed at $9,481. Recently, the pair started an upside correction and traded above the $10,000 resistance level. Moreover, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last major decline from the $12,321 high to $9,481 low. The bulls even managed to push the price above the $10,500 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). However, the upward move was capped by the key $10,950 and $11,000 resistance levels. More importantly, there is a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $11,000 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last major decline from the $12,321 high to $9,481 low is capping upsides near the $10,920 level. At the moment, the price is correcting lower below $10,700. An immediate support is near the $10,500 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). It seems like the $10,500 support might play an important role. The price could both bounce back from $10,500 and break the $11,000 resistance or it might start a fresh decline. A successful close below the $10,500 support might put the bulls on the back foot. The next key support on the downside below $10,500 is near the $10,000 level.  Looking at the chart, bitcoin price is clearly approaching the next key break either above $11,000 or below $10,500. As long as there is no daily close below $10,500, there are chances of a strong upward move towards $12,000. If not, the price might slide back towards the $9,500 level. 4 hour MACD  The MACD is currently losing momentum in the bullish zone. 4 hour RSI (Relative Strength Index)  The RSI is currently declining towards the 50 level.

It sounds like Nakamoto is driving every cryptocurrency enthusiast to madness. As reported by Live Bitcoin News earlier this morning, a post emerged over the weekend from someone claiming to be the reclusive inventor of bitcoin. In the post, the writer claimed to be a national from the Middle East who was now living in London and had changed his name to James Caan. Many, including crypto entrepreneur Jeff Garzik, scowled at this idea. Garzik has purportedly communicated with the real Nakamoto over the years via email and says that the writing style associated with the man is very different from what he saw in the post. Now, its quite possible that Nakamoto is changing his writing patterns somewhat to throw his followers off. Maybe this is the real person and hes simply trying to retain some level of anonymity while putting other questions at rest. Still, Garzik  and several others  remain unconvinced. Either way, they dont seem to be driving themselves insane with the idea. Youssef, on the other hand, appears very eager to rid the world of the mystery behind Satoshi Nakamoto once and for all. In a recent tweet, Youssef called on his followers  industry leaders like Coinbase executive Brian Armstrong and Roger Ver, playfully referred to as the Bitcoin Jesus  to burn Satoshis bitcoins and rid the world of his presence once and for all. The message says: Lets burn all of Satoshis 980,000 [bitcoins]. [One] million less coins and we lay Satoshi to rest in peace. The proposal appears rather unorthodox And heavy, to say the least. We all are wracking our brains regarding who Nakamoto is, but to suggest that such a large sum be burned (more than $10 billion in USD) and that a lifetime of hard work and earnings be dispatched in a matter of minutes is scary and over-the-top. Several people immediately jumped to Nakamotos defense, with one Twitter user responding: So, the bitcoin creator doesnt deserve this money? Whoever he may be or has been? What a totalitarian and egoistic idea. Another individual wrote: Its an idea as stupid as CZs idea to roll back the chain after the Binance hack. While destroying that many bitcoins is a possibility, Youssef would need permission across the entire bitcoin network to do this. Otherwise, the result would be a splitting of the bitcoin network into two separate entities, where Nakamoto owns BTC on one side but not the other. At the same time, a lot of questions would ultimately dissipate, and the market could probably be in safer hands. ","['bitcoin', 'Ray Youssef', 'Satoshi Nakamoto']"

According to Digital Asset Research, the probability is very high. Over the past several months, everybody has weighed in on what they think the future of the bitcoin price entails. Since April of this year, bitcoin has been on something of a roll, jumping from the high $3,000 range to about $5,000 during that time. Since then, it has continued a heavy pattern of jumps and spikes that ultimately took the currency up into the mid-$13,000 range at one point before it fell to its present trading level of just over $10,700. It appears this newfound bullish behavior  following an entire year of ugly and depressing droops in the price (in 2018)  has somehow rejuvenated not only interest in the coin itself, but in predictions regarding where the currency will stand within the next two to three years. Venture capitalist Tim Draper, for example, is suggesting that the currency will likely hit the $250,000 range by the year 2023. This is a little later than his previous prediction of 2022, but its not that far off. Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee has also made a serious career out predicting where bitcoin will go. Whats different about Digital Asset Research, however, is that its basing its newfound predictions on scarcity, something many other predictors have failed to account for in the past. As we all know, bitcoin is not an infinite currency. If it were, it would likely remain at a specific price throughout the duration of its life. Scarcity is what makes a resource valuable. Those who invest in gold, silver and other precious metals are familiar with this, and in the case of bitcoin, scarcity is taking a dramatic shift. There are only about 21 million BTC units in the world, and thus far, about 18 million have been mined or extracted. That means there are only three million units not in circulation. Bitcoin is getting expensive because it is rare. Once all bitcoins are in circulation and being moved about on exchanges and through wallets, were likely to witness the currency fall significantly. The firm is taking several items into consideration. Not only is bitcoins rarity at stake, but it is also set for another halving mid-next year, which means that the number of rewards currently being offered to miners will be cut in half, driving the currencys scarcity into even murkier waters. The companys price report says that if history repeats itself, the bitcoin price will spike to new heights one-third of the way through the new halving, thereby taking each unit to a whopping $60,595. The report says that the currency could potentially find its ceiling the following year in 2021. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Digital Asset Research']"

Who is the man behind bitcoin, and what circumstances led him to lead a life of such secrecy? These are questions that are likely to keep every cryptocurrency enthusiast up at night. No answers have ever come about, though there have been many people to claim the eponymous title, only to have everyone spew doubt and turn their backs away. One such person is Jeff Garzik, who says he used to communicate via email with who he claims is the real Satoshi Nakamoto. While hes never met the man with the suspicious name, they have repeatedly corresponded behind the hidden safety of their computers. Over the weekend, a post emerged online that was allegedly written by Nakamoto following a long disappearance. Garzik is convinced the post is a hoax. He says the writing style doesnt match that of the man he spoke with years ago, and hes doubtful Nakamoto has resurfaced. In the post, Nakamotos identity is allegedly revealed. The writer suggests he is a Pakistani national who now calls the United Kingdom home. Originally from Bilal Khalid, the man writing the post claimed he had changed his name to James Caan, the same as an actor from films like Honeymoon in Vegas, Misery and The Godfather. The problem with the post, according to Garzik, is that while it has indeed stirred heavy interest from the crypto-going public, it doesnt contain any new information. Instead, it shows only data that is already available to most readers, suggesting that the writer is simply copying facts from other sources and running them up in the post to make them appear new or surprising. Garzik says he hears from would-be Satoshis on a regular basis, and states: I actually get this every couple of months  a new fraud every couple of months. Usually, its either information, or its a common scam: all my bitcoins are locked up, so send me some of yours. Among the many people claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto over the years includes Australian scientist Craig Wright, who is currently involved in several lawsuits on the matter. Many people seriously doubt that Wright is telling the truth. In fact, all Wright would have to do to prove his identity would be to partake in a specific transaction that would move some of the bitcoins allegedly in Satoshis original wallet to a separate one  an action Wright has refused in the past. Garzik states: The litmus test is always pretty definite and easy to prove or disprove. Its signing something with a digital signature. Thus far, no one has used a digital signature for messages that only the original bitcoin creator knows. ","['bitcoin', 'craig wright', 'jeff garzik', 'Satoshi Nakamoto']"

The currency appears to be recovering amidst the news that Bakkt  a cryptocurrency trading platform being launched by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)  is set for release this coming September. That means that in less than a month, the system that everyones been talking about for roughly one year will be here. Bakkt is a platform designed to offer cryptocurrencies a higher level of legitimacy. Much like Flexa is doing, Bakkt is working towards recruiting retail players so that customers can potentially pay with digital currencies for goods and services. It was originally reported  when Bakkt first made headlines in late 2018  that companies like Starbucks were going to allow the purchase of baked goods and drinks with digital currencies, but that ultimately turned out to be false. Still, Bakkt is working with various retail merchants to allow for the utilization of crypto as a means of payment, which has been the primary goal of entities like bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS and Litecoin since the days of their conceptions. Virtual money, which is highly speculative in nature, was originally built so that users who did not have access to standard credit or banking products, could utilize it to get their hands on the daily items they needed to provide for themselves or their families. Unfortunately, crypto is quite volatile, which means it can go up and down in price at a moments notice. If you use digital currency to pay for $50-worth of merchandise, but tomorrow the crypto you use goes down in value, youll still walk away with everything you bought. The receiving company, however, will see what they garnered in the transaction shrink, which isnt entirely fair. Bitcoin, for the most part, has experienced a very wobbly two weeks. While the currency originally started this period at a whopping $11,700 (many were convinced $12,000 was right around the corner), the currency ultimately fell into the $11,300 region and hovered there for several days. It later fell to $10,900, then $10,500, and finally $10,050. It later began rising and falling between $10,100 and $10,300. While its price is now higher thanks, in part, to the news surrounding Bakkt, its still roughly $1,000 below where it began the mentioned two-week timeframe. Thus, while bitcoin is solid when compared to where it stood yesterday and in the few days before then, it still has plenty of room for improvement. $11,000 probably isnt out of the question following the release of Bakkt, though whats unclear is if such a gain would last as according to various technical charts, the currency is likely slated to for further bearish activity.

As the main form of crypto in the digital currency marketplace, bitcoin has set the bar very high, and all digital entrepreneurs and blockchain businesses are trying their best to outperform it, but how realistic is this goal? According to Erik Finman, its very realistic. Finman is classified as a teen bitcoin millionaire according to Yahoo Finance. Finman has been backing a new crypto startup simply known as Metal for the past two years. One would assume that Finman, given the money he has and the amount of crypto experience under his belt, knows what hes talking about when it comes to the next big craze in digital finance. However, Metal has had a relatively rocky history since it first emerged in 2017. It has fallen by more than 98 percent in value, so Finmans endorsement of the company is strange to say the least. He has also had a very up-and-down relationship with bitcoin itself. Finman declared late last year that bitcoin had finally reached its end, and that crypto was on the verge of collapsing altogether. However, Finman began 2019 with a new prediction  that the granddaddy of crypto would, once again, spike to $20,000+ levels as it almost did in December of 2017. In a recent interview, he states: Bitcoin could be at $50,000 per bitcoin without all the fragmentation, but you cant change the fees. You cant change the loading times. Im very pro-crypto and pro-bitcoin, but with just one coin, you can only do so much. This is criticism weve heard before. Bitcoin, while larger than most newer forms of crypto, arguably holds less technical prowess. For example, the currency has been knocked in the past given how long its transaction times are. Many newer forms of crypto  such as Ethereum or EOS  usually experience faster transactions that can be completed within a matter of minutes. Bitcoin on the other hand, usually takes a few days to move around. Metals token was originally trading for about $13 per unit, but ultimately fell when most other forms of crypto dropped in early 2018. The token wound up losing nearly all its value and is currently trading at 30 cents per coin. Finmans support for Metal comes on the verge of Metal Pays release, a new digital currency payment platform bent on competing with the likes of Venmo and PayPal. Its possible this is the primary reason for the support. Founder and chief executive of Metal Pay Marshall Hayner explains: Weve worked for years to make certain that all laws and regulations are met to deliver the best possible product for our user base.

While greed had significantly dropped given bitcoins sudden fall to its greatest lows since November 2018, many have concern about what will happen given bitcoins drooping position in the market and where it might go from here. It appears that sentiment is being echoed in several places around the world, making the fear of crypto a global epidemic of sorts. In Austria, for example, a recent survey has emerged to suggest that most people within the county dont trust cryptocurrencies and dont see them as the future of money. The survey, jokingly titled Bitcoin has few friends in Austria, was released over the past few days and conducted by the financial institution ING. The company surveyed several regions of Europe, as well as Australia and the United States. According to the survey, most skeptics currently call Austria home. The study reported that only 13 percent of the countrys citizens possess positive sentiment towards cryptocurrencies. This is odd given that the country recently opened the doors of its new digital trading platform. Known as Bit Panda, the company raised approximately 43.6 million euros through its latest initial exchange offering (IEO). Thats more than $50 million in USD, so obviously someone in Austria thinks crypto has a lot to offer. Nevertheless, executives at ING stick by their findings and offered this statement following the results: The ING International Survey shows very clearly what the Austrians value  namely security in payment transactions and investment. Risk or strong price fluctuations want to be avoided as much as possible, so it is not surprising that crypto money does not find fertile ground in this country. Sentiment for bitcoin and other digital currencies was considerably higher in regions like the United States, where according to the survey, about 31 percent of citizens have positive feelings towards virtual money. Throughout other regions of Europe, sentiment was considerably higher. Among the top-ranking nations were Turkey (with 62 percent positivity towards crypto), Romania (with 44 percent positivity), and Poland (with 43 percent positivity). Per ING, Austria felt stronger about crypto last year, with positivity marks roughly three percent higher. While this isnt a huge difference, it does suggest that attitudes towards virtual coins in that part of the continent are continuing to fall at a steady rate. The news is strange to say the least, considering the lagging regulations surrounding crypto that countries such as Austria presently face. While no regulation is never a good thing, lessened regulation can lead to very serious opportunities, such as new businesses and economic growth. These enterprises are not yet weighed down by rules that stifle innovation. ","['Austria', 'bitcoin', 'crypto', 'ING']"

This is where it stood roughly 48 hours ago, though during yesterdays early morning hours, the price had fallen to roughly $10,166. This means that the currency has jumped by about $200 in the last day. This is always good news, but it doesnt change the fact that fear is spreading throughout the crypto space, mainly over what regulations we can potentially expect in the coming months or years. Its true that for the time being, bitcoin is showing some signs of moving back up, but the truth remains that not long ago, the currency dropped about 20 percent and experienced its worst fall in over nine months. That was when it was trading for about $3,500 during November of 2018. It appears Facebooks Libra has opened Pandoras box. Regulators and lawmakers everywhere reacted with extreme aggression and concern over what Libra had in store for users, and while it may have seemed a bit over the top, you cant deny that there are reasons for some of this concern. For example, Facebook was tied to Cambridge Analytica in 2018. Following a lengthy Senate hearing in which the company was grilled for allegedly selling customers private data to third parties for advertising purposes, Facebook faced fines that amounted to several billion dollars. Trust in Facebook isnt at its highest point, and even dropped by about 66 percent following the hearing. So, when legislative officials heard that Facebook had plans to enter the financial space and that it wanted to monitor peoples monetary activity, they jumped into action and sought to learn more. Christel Quek, chief commercial officer at Bolt Global (an entertainment company and cryptocurrency wallet provider) explained in an interview: The currency regulatory roadblock on Facebooks plans for its digital token has dimmed down investor sentiment for cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies including Litecoin, Ethereum, and Ripples XRP have declined [this week], weighed down by concerns of a slowing economy. That slowing economy is largely being contributed to President Trumps trade war with China, though several billion dollars in tariffs have since been postponed, and we likely wont see them take effect for the next few months. Unfortunately, bitcoin has still lost some stamina regarding its digital gold status. While its still viewed as a solid investment amongst some enthusiasts, the idea that it will somehow protect them from losing their wealth has died down a bit considering the stock market has shown mild signs of recovery and the mentioned tariffs have been pushed back. Per social media and other public forums, the attitude among many crypto traders is one of fear rather than greed, which has fallen heavily since bitcoin (albeit briefly) dropped below the $10,000 mark earlier this week.

South America has proven to be a major bitcoin and cryptocurrency haven. Countries like Venezuela, for example, have seen their national currencies subjected to either inflation or other economic problems that ultimately render them useless or inaccessible to native residents. Many have turned to cryptocurrencies like Dash and bitcoin to get their fingers on daily needs such as food and clothing, but Venezuelas government isnt adding much to the pot in terms of assistance. For example, Venezuelas president Nicolas Maduro has recently introduced the Petro, a national cryptocurrency allegedly backed by the nations many oil reserves. There is no mention of these oil reserves in the currencys whitepaper, and many believe this notion to be false. In addition, Maduro has also tried to work a plan into Venezuelas economy that would allow workers to be paid in Petro units rather than the countrys failing bolivar currency. Unfortunately, this plan has failed to catch on. At press time, the Petro has stirred so much controversy that President Donald Trump has banned all Petro trading within the United States. While the Petro may have failed in its initial dealings, other cryptocurrencies  like bitcoin and now Ethereum  are garnering new popularity within Venezuela and its South American neighbors. It seems Colombia is turning its sights to Ethereum according to a new survey conducted by Paxful, a peer-to-peer trading platform that allows users to sell, purchase and trade cryptocurrencies privately. The survey suggests that approximately 87 percent of citizens in Colombia are aware of crypto, while another 80 percent say theyre looking into potential investing options. At press time, however, its very difficult for people to garner access to cryptocurrencies given what Paxful CEO Ray Youssef calls a poor regulatory framework. He comments: Countries around the world are now taking a closer look at how to contend with the rise of the crypto-economy and the survey reinforced that. We did a university tour in some African countries earlier this year, and we hope to replicate it in Colombia and other countries in Latin America. Further details of the survey showed that over half of the survey respondents were women, suggesting that a female presence in the crypto arena is growing steadily. Also, nearly 60 percent were within the ages of 18 and 34. Lastly, only three cryptocurrencies made it onto the preferred lists of many of these participants. They were bitcoin (which occupied the number one spot), then Ethereum and Bytecoin. Perhaps the most positive data came in the form of 91 percent of surveyed Colombians stating they think crypto will mark the future of world trade. They also showed great acceptance and desire for regulation. ","['Colombia', 'Ethereum', 'Paxful']"

Yesterday, the currency gave enthusiasts a little bit of hope after it rose to nearly $10,500 during the late afternoon hours. Previously, the currency had been falling by as much as $500 per day for the past several days, leaving many looking for answers. Just last week, the currency was trading at a solid $11,700, but later fell to about $11,300. It stayed here for a few days before falling to $10,900, then $10,500 and finally stopping at around $10,050. Many were concerned that the cryptocurrency would re-enter $9,000 territory, though the asset proved its strength yet again by regaining enough footage just in time. It later rose to $10,300 during yesterdays early morning hours, before experiencing another quick gain to place it in the mid-$10,000 range. Unfortunately, at press time, it looks like bitcoin is hovering at around $10,166. Overall, this has been one of the most unstable weeks for bitcoin over the past nine months, with the currency falling by 20 percent over just the last seven days alone. So, why? Thats always every enthusiasts big question. What makes bitcoin jump around like that? Why cant it just decide to be bullish and remain so? Jeff Dorman, the chief investment officer of asset manager Arca, explained that the trade war did the most damage to bitcoins stability. While in most cases, people saw bitcoin as a potential safe haven against drooping wealth and stock market crashes, the fear didnt last that long. When things began to die down and some stocks showed signs of stabilizing, bitcoins greatness was bound to ease up, especially now that Chinas national currency has strengthened, and President Trump is postponing further tariffs. But things havent stopped there. Several personal events occurred within the cryptocurrency space, such as the dead partnership between Coinbase  a U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange  and London banking firm Barclays. The two enterprises had been working together since March of this year, and to see the partnership end so quickly suggests that the U.K. is likely taking a harsher approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Live Bitcoin News reported on this news just days ago. Chris Keshian, a former crypto hedge fund manager, comments: These fluctuations are driven predominantly by traders. The market is stabilizing at around $10K after the run earlier this year. He further states that several investors were simply buying the dip. However, one of the biggest contributing factors to bitcoins sudden decrease was the Securities and Exchange Commissions (SECs) decision to, once again, delay several bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including one submitted by VanEck SolidX. This proposal has been waiting in the wings for well over a year and has experienced several delays along the way. ","['barclays', 'bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'coinbase']"

Now, its trading for just shy of $10,400, which means the currency has hiked itself up a bit in the past 24 hours, but its still a major fall. One of the reasons could be because tensions over the U.S.-China trade war have seemingly loosened up a bit. At press time, some stocks are showing signs of recovery, and bitcoin  along with other assets like gold  are looked at as shields against economic downturns. Thus, it makes sense that bitcoin would suddenly spike over the last two weeks following announcements that President Trump would be enforcing further tariffs on approximately $300 billion-worth of items from China. Now, however, some of these fears and tensions are beginning to dissipate, which means that bitcoin and other forms of crypto are suddenly down for the count given that people arent looking at them through the same lens as they were 12 days ago. Overall, it seems the currency has fallen by anywhere between 12 and 15 percent over the past week alone. Analysts say that the idea of bitcoin serving as a safe asset has somewhat evaporated. Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. explains: People thought at certain points in the last year or so that cryptocurrencies would become the flight to safety trade. The cryptocurrency is losing some of that luster of being considered a safe asset. Fears arose recently regarding bitcoins alleged ties to a potential Ponzi scheme. According to a Twitter post submitted by crypto influencer Dovey Wan, individuals involved in a Plus Token scam were potentially selling several thousand bitcoins in small batches. However, researchers at Token Analyst explain that this likely isnt the case, and bitcoins drop is simply part of a moving economy. Company co-founder Sid Shekhar spoke of the crypto wallet addresses associated with the Plus Token trades. He explained: It doesnt look like any of these addresses are exchange owned, so that was enlightening. Well keep an eye on this to see if they do move the 100s of millions into exchanges at some point. The big question now is, Where will bitcoin go from here? Can we expect to see further drops in the coming weeks, or will the coin recover and resort to bullish behavior sooner than we might expect? Given that the currency has spiked again and is trading for $300 higher than where it stood just a day ago, we can probably expect a small recovery stage in the immediate future, though given were about to enter the final quarter of the year, its hard to say what will happen for sure.

In late 2017, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies made a serious mark on the financial industry by reaching their highest prices to date. Bitcoin, for example, ultimately shot up to about $20,000 per unit after a year of steady gains, but beginning in January, the cryptocurrency began to experience drops that ultimately brought it down to roughly $6,000 by the summertime. Five months later, come Thanksgiving, bitcoin was trading in the mid-$3,000 range, marking a 70 percent loss of value. Several other coins, such as Ethereum and EOS, fell even further, experiencing losses of roughly 80 or even 90 percent in some cases. While crypto has been doing better since last April, the tech firm has stated that its revenue hasnt fully bounced back. In 2017, when crypto was doing well and surging faster than anyone could have predicted, the company was selling graphics cards to individuals and companies alike suddenly interested in the process of mining and extracting new coins. However, those days are long gone, and with the price drops of all mainstream crypto in 2018, Nvidia reports that general interest is down for the count. The company has released its second quarter earnings for the year, and income is still down by approximately 17 percent in comparison with this time during 2018. The good news is that earnings werent as low as analysts initially predicted. Overall, they were expecting something at around $2.54 billion, but income ultimately came in slightly above that at $2.58 billion. As a result, Nvidia stock shares have risen by approximately seven percent in the last 24 hours alone. The report shows that the companys gaming products are still the biggest money-makers for Nvidia. Overall, these products have brought in more than $1.3 billion  a massive jump from the $1 billion figure listed during the previous quarter. Gaming products currently account for more than 50 percent of the companys total sales and revenue. However, even the gaming division is suffering financially given that the total is down from $1.8 billion approximately one year ago. Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress, however, is confident that the arena will bounce back, especially with the release of Nintendos new Switch console (which utilizes Nvidia technology) and the release of laptop products built with Nvidia properties. In addition, the company is also witnessing the release of the Switch Lite, which should help to get it back on its feet. Kress describes Nvidias operations as returning to normal, which may have to be good enough for the company right now given the implications of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war thats likely to affect income streams even further.

Thus far, the operation has been successful in targeting as many as 35 different platforms. Crypto scams are running rampant within the space. Many are looking to take advantage of those who dont know any better or have little knowledge of the crypto space by enticing them with the prospects of what can still be considered a brand new and relatively untapped market. States like Texas, for example, have become a hot spot for fraudulent investment systems, many of which have been issued cease-and-desist letters from the Texas attorney general. Several of these companies offer ridiculously high returns, which ultimately raise red flags with state regulators. Such is the case with a recent bitcoin trading platform in Maryland targeted by the states present operation. The company was telling its investors that they could garner quick returns of 150 percent or more through passive investments within the cryptocurrency market. Attorney General Brian E. Frosh says that the number of illicit players attracted to the scene have largely been brought on by bitcoins surging value as of late and the entry of Facebook to the crypto space. In a statement, he explains: Cryptocurrency investments are risky. Investors should be extra cautious when dealing with promoters who claim that their offering does not have to be registered with securities regulators. Quick returns of 150 percent are as rare as Bigfoot. Make sure to do independent research on the product before you invest. Be aware of the risks and contact the Maryland Securities Division with any concerns before parting with your hard-earned money. The Maryland Securities Division, in turn, has prepared a short video for people to educate themselves regarding the risks and dangers that come with cryptocurrencies. The video warns of assets volatility, saying that price swings are quite common among many forms of crypto and that investors should only invest funds that wont make a different in their overall wealth or well-being. In addition, the video also warns that many cryptocurrency transactions are allegedly untraceable and that there is little regulatory presence in the crypto space, meaning any funds that are stolen or subjected to fraud may disappear for good if investors arent careful. Another company making a crypto-related video is the BBC, a British media company. The video, at six minutes long, is designed to help non-English speakers better understand crypto investments and to provide basic crypto terminology. It also serves as an introduction to bitcoin and Libra. ","['crypto fraud', 'Maryland', 'Texas']"

At press time, the company is expanding into Canada, where approximately 7,500 stores and retailers are set to begin accepting crypto in exchange for goods and services. Since the beginning, cryptocurrencies have sought to be utilized as means of payment. For anyone without access to applicable credit or to a proper bank account, getting their fingers on credit cards, checks or even cash half the time can be difficult, which is where crypto can usually take the reins. Digital currencies can be processed very quickly; money moves in and out of a digital account within a matter of minutes. Unfortunately, the volatility of said cryptocurrencies has often gotten in the way of digital assets true goals. Many stores are reluctant to accept cryptocurrency payments given that these coins are vulnerable to severe price swings that can cause them to drop within a matter of moments. Bitcoin, for example, is trading for just over $10,050 at press time. This is a major drop from the $10,500 it was holding yesterday, and the $10,900 mark it was at the day before. Just last week, bitcoin was trading above $11,300 and $11,700 respectively. That means that in roughly seven days, the granddaddy of all crypto has lost almost $2,000 in value. At one moment, bitcoin is doing quite well, while the next, its drudging through the gutter. If one were to have paid with bitcoin during this time, they would have walked off with their merchandise regardless, but the store accepting the payment would have lost a lot of money. Its not entirely fair to the retailer in question, which is why so many companies are quick to turn their backs on the idea of accepting digital currency. Flexa is looking to change all this. The company has made a deal with Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Coin Square to boost its presence within the country. This will be its first venture outside the United States, and customers will be able to make payments in a wide array of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Ethereum, bitcoin cash, Zcash, Litecoin and the Gemini dollar. The process will begin in the first week of September. Flexa also has whats called the SPEDN app that allows Canadians visiting the United States to make crypto payments at several major U.S.-based retailers, such as Starbucks. The app was developed in partnership with New Yorks Gemini Exchange, founded by the Winklevoss Twins of The Social Network fame. In a blog post, Flexa explains: We think that seamless, fee-free, cross-border commerce is one of the most impactful use cases that cryptocurrency can provide.

Regions such as Argentina and Hong Kong, for example, are willing to pay premiums on the top cryptocurrency despite its latest drops, suggesting just how strong and popular it is in developing nations. While Argentina isnt quite in the same state as its continental neighbor to the north Venezuela, election uncertainty in the nation has caused its national currency, the peso, to drop by more than 30 percent over the past few days. On exchanges such as LocalBitcoins.com, bitcoin was trading for as high as $12,000 in the country of Argentina. This is about ten percent higher than where it stands on most other trading platforms. In Hong Kong, where people are protesting the notions of communism and seeking independence from the mainland Chinese government, bitcoin was trading for a roughly four percent premium. Despite the breadth and width of the protests (theyve been going on since June), many are now in fear that government forces will consider extreme forms of retaliation. Rayne Steinberg, the chief executive officer of crypto hedge fund Arca in Los Angeles, explains: Bitcoin is becoming the asset of last resort in areas of extreme currency devaluation and political uncertainty. In the last week alone, bitcoin is up by approximately 50 percent against the Argentine peso and trading at a significant premium on local exchanges, and they are not alone, joining the ranks of Venezuela, Hong Kong and Turkey who have also experienced similar shocks. Venezuelas national currency, the bolivar, has fallen even further than the peso. Inflation and economic disaster are so prominent within the socialist country that many market shelves are bare, and citizens have resorted to attacking zoo animals to put meat on their tables. While the country sought to implement a new payout system for workers utilizing the countrys official cryptocurrency (the Petro), the idea initially failed to catch on, and Venezuelas economic infrastructure remains in disarray. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (like Dash) have proven to be very popular and useful in countries such as these. The problem is that these assets remain volatile, as weve witnessed in just the last 24 hours alone. Bitcoin, for example, has fallen by more than $400 in just the last day, and that price was a fall of roughly $800 from the previous week. There are concerns that Venezuela, Argentina and other areas resorting to bitcoin may just be trading one seriously volatile asset in for another, which isnt likely to do much in terms of national stabilization. Alex Kruger, a crypto trader, has mentioned that if Argentinians really seek to protect themselves, their best bet is to purchase American dollars.

This is about $400 less than where it stood yesterday and nearly $1,000 less than where it stood just last week. For the most part, bitcoin has been going through serious up-and-down phases since the end of June. Originally, the currency struck the $13,000 mark and seemed poised to jump up to $14,000. Unfortunately, the coin ultimately fell before this task could be tackled properly, and its been trapped in a lava lamp of sorts ever since. The currency moves up, then it moves back down, and nothing that significant appears to be occurring as of late. While bitcoin did strike a new low since its bullish behavior began in April of this year  ultimately falling to about $9,400 just a few weeks ago  the currency later rose back up into the $10,000 range and then $11,000. It seemed ready to head for $12,000 next thanks, in large part, to the U.S.-China trade war thats been hitting the markets hard over the past month. Such global strife caused many to see bitcoin as a form of digital gold; a tool designed to battle the incoming signs of a recession and keep holders safe from financial woe. But now, it appears the effects and the tension of the trade war are subsiding a little, which means that rather than spiking to $12,000 like so many analysts predicted, bitcoin has fallen to the mid-$10,000 range. Stocks are still trapped in a dismal position, but they did experience a dead cat bounce over the past 24 hours. Yet, it appears as though bitcoin and gold are still slated to spike higher. Many analysts say that while the effects of the trade war have lessened a bit, markets arent completely out of the dark. Many consumers and traders alike are still experiencing fear of the future and are stocking up what they can to keep themselves safe. Gold experienced its highest price earlier this year, spiking beyond the $1,500 mark, though it has ultimately fallen since then, and some do not believe the asset will touch this range again by the time 2019 ceases. At the same time, the dismal state of stocks isnt likely to last long. For the most part, shares in several companies did go up less than a day ago thanks to President Trump delaying new China tariffs by approximately three months. While this is good news, it is only temporary and likely to take us into darker territory by the end of the year.

There was a break above the $12,000 resistance and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Finally, the price tested the $12,321 level and started a major downside correction. There was a break below the $11,800 and $11,500 support levels. Moreover, the price settled below $11,500 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). More importantly, there was a break below a major bullish trend line with support near $11,750 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is now trading below the $11,000 support plus the 50% Fib retracement level of the main major upward move from the $9,087 low to $12,321 high. An immediate support on the downside is near the $10,500 level. The main support is near the $10,300 and $10,200 levels. It coincides with the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the main major upward move from the $9,087 low to $12,321 high. If there is a downside break below the $10,200 support area, the price could start a strong slide towards the last swing low at $9,087. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $10,800 level. To start a fresh increase, the price has to surpass the $11,100 and $11,200 levels. Moreover, the 55 simple moving average (4-hours) is positioned along with a bearish trend line on the upside near $11,550, which is the next crucial hurdle.  Looking at the chart, bitcoin price is clearly trading in a downtrend from the $12,321 swing high. If the $10,200 support fails to hold the current decline, there could be a bearish extension.

Luckily for them, many new classes and courses are available to help them understand what crypto and blockchain is all about. While there have been studies in the past showing well-known universities and state colleges offering classes in the subjects of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, many of these come with expensive price tags. As we all know, the United States is suffering from severe student loan debt  nearly $1.5 trillion at press time  which means college classes are usually priced to the hilt. While getting a degree in the subject of crypto is likely to take lots of money and time away, there are other options available to you that are either free or cost only a fraction of the price. If youre simply looking to get a stronger feel for crypto before you invest, or if youre just starting out and want to learn a little more about digital assets before taking bigger steps, these classes and others like them could be the answers youre looking for. In one course  Introduction to Digital Currencies offered by UNIC  students have the honor of calling Andreas Antonopoulos their teacher. As a renowned crypto expert whos been making his home in the space for the past several years, Antonopoulos has authored several books on blockchain and digital assets including Mastering Bitcoin. To take his class is the equivalent of enrolling in an acting course taught by Al Pacino or a film directing class by Steven Spielberg. Youre arguably learning from a true master. The class offers its students a brief history of money, while integrating when cryptocurrencies came about and how they fit into the general scope of the global financial infrastructure. It also talks about how these assets are being implemented into the general financial system, which companies seek to permit crypto payments, and how banks and cryptocurrencies interact with each other. Once the course is over, students are given a final exam to give their teacher an idea of how well theyve retained the knowledge. Coinbase, the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange is also teaching a few classes. One, called Coinbase Learn, provides students with flashcards regarding the basics of crypto. These flashcards deal with several topics including how to buy and sell digital assets to the process of extracting new coins. Theres also Coinbase Earn, which discusses several different altcoins that students will ultimately earn by testing and scoring well. Think of it: do well in the class and then get paid for it. No doubt, students are looking to practice hard in this class. ","['Andreas Antonopoulos', 'coinbase', 'crypto classes']"

For the most part, the trade war is not having serious effects on average consumers in either country, but it is affecting the general markets. Stock prices in the U.S., for example, have been down for the past two weeks, and President Trump has shown a strong willingness to continue what he believes is right by instilling tariffs on another $300 billion-worth of items set to take effect in early September. Thus, assets like bitcoin are now being viewed as safe havens. Fiat tends to be vulnerable during economic scrutiny, and Chinas national currency, the yuan, has already devalued somewhat since the start of the trade conflict. At press time, it has fallen under seven to the U.S. dollar, and is trading at its lowest position in roughly ten years. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been experiencing solid gains as of late, shooting well past the $11,000 mark about a week-and-a-half ago. Currently, the asset is trading for just shy of $11,400. Green explains: This is not a coincidence. It reveals that consensus is growing that bitcoin is becoming a flight-to-safety asset during times of market uncertainty. Bitcoin is currently realizing its reputation as a form of digital gold. Up to now, gold has been known as the ultimate safe asset, but bitcoin, which shares its key characteristics of being a store of value and scarcity, could potentially dethrone gold in the future as the world becomes increasingly digitalized. Recently, President Trump took the liberty of labeling China a currency manipulator, which caused the yuan to fall even further. Thus, investors are likely to continue their stockpiling of decentralized assets like bitcoin and really up the ante regarding how much theyre purchasing. With the threat of the trade war becoming ever more present, those seeking refuge are doing so in a more panic-stricken state, and bitcoin trades and purchases are likely to increase tenfold over the coming weeks. He explains: The legitimate risks posed by the continuing trade dispute, Chinas currency devaluation and other geopolitical issues, such as Brexit and its far-reaching associated challenges, will lead an increasing number of institutional and retail investors to diversify their portfolios and hedge against those risks by investing in crypto assets. This will drive the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies higher. Under the current circumstances, I believe the bitcoin price could hit $15,000 within weeks. Green isnt the only analyst suggesting higher marks for bitcoin. Venture capitalist Tim Draper believes the currency could spike to as much as $250,000 per unit within the next three years, though he recently pushed this prediction back a few months.

This isnt the first time a nation has sought to utilize cryptocurrency to pay out its workforce. One of the first was Venezuela, which has been subjected to severe poverty over the years given inflation and the financial death of its national currency the bolivar. At press time, store shelves are practically bare, and many residents have sought to attacking zoo animals to put meat on their tables. Given the countrys financial problems, President Nicolas Maduro has sought to implement a new system in which workers are paid in Petro funds, rather than the bolivar. The Petro is the new national cryptocurrency implemented by Venezuela. Making its official debut in early 2018, reports emerged (likely false) that suggested billions of Petro units were sold through its initial coin offering (ICO). For the most part, however, the Petro has remained purely speculative given all the shady details surrounding its properties and creation. For one thing, the coin is allegedly backed by the countrys many oil reserves, though analysts say this is untrue and even point out that theres no mention of oil reserves in the currencys whitepaper. The controversy surrounding the Petro has become so severe that U.S. President Donald Trump has instilled a ban on all future Petro trading. This time, things are a little different. New Zealand is implementing the same paycheck system only with bitcoin instead of Petro funds. Bitcoin is far more mainstream and well-known that the Venezuelan currency, but that doesnt mean issues wont arise. For one thing, bitcoin is not a stable currency, meaning its not tied to fiat. Thus, New Zealand is making it mandatory that all persons who receive their paychecks in bitcoin must convert the funds immediately into fiat through a government exchange platform. Thus, a person does not have the option of letting his or her paycheck grow or subjecting it speculative purposes. In addition, only workers making more than a set amount have this option available to them, and they must be salaried employees working under legitimate company contracts. That means all independent contractors, freelancers or gig-seekers cannot take advantage of the bitcoin payout system. For the most part, this system seems to be in an experimental stage. It will go into effect on September 1 of this year and remain in effect for roughly three years. Depending on the success of the system, it could continue or ultimately cease without notice. Either way, one things for certain: bitcoin and crypto have become mainstream enough that global markets are at least willing to try new processes like these, rather than dismiss digital assets altogether.

It appears that cryptocurrencies are becoming less about speculation and more about payments, which was the original goal of several available digital assets today. Its a good thing to see so many forms of crypto move deeper into payments territory over investment territory. While there are no doubt people out there that will continue to purchase bitcoin, Ethereum and other forms of crypto to potentially build their portfolios and wealth, there are also likely to be just as many people across the globe that seek to utilize cryptocurrencies for their purchasing capabilities. As many of us already know, cryptocurrencies were initially built to be used as methods of payment for goods and services. Unfortunately, their volatility has seriously gotten in the way of their being accepted by standard retail stores. If you purchase $50 worth of materials with bitcoin for example, and tomorrow the coin goes down, youll walk away with what youve purchased while the store in question will wind up losing money. Its not always fair to the receiving party, which is why so many companies have turned up their noses at the prospects of cryptocurrency payments. Several payment platforms, however, are looking to turn things around and give digital assets a clear path towards their initial goals of replacing fiat, checks and credit cards as a means of purchasing specific items. Among those companies are platforms like Skrill, Circle and Square, which is headed by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The company has recently issued a statement explaining that its looking to improve money and potentially boost cryptocurrency use throughout the globe by expanding payment networks. Square is now establishing a new cryptocurrency and blockchain division. The company says its very close to making its first hire. Primarily, the company is focusing on boosting bitcoin, which it allegedly feels is the prime cryptocurrency in the space. Overall, Square is looking to improve the infrastructure. Naturally, Square isnt alone, and the venture will face some serious competition along the way from establishments like Jeremy Allaires Circle organization, which recently joined hands with popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to release a stable currency known as the United States Dollar Coin (USDC). Where Circle will likely take the lead is in the space of regulation. Allaire has spoken openly that he thinks the cryptocurrency industry requires strict regulation to thrive and expand. Hes confident this will help establish blockchain as a leading form of technology and potentially put the U.S. back on the map in terms of technical leadership and innovation. He explains: The increase in proliferation of digital asset projects outside the U.S., the movement of companies to leave the U.S. and projects to get started outside the U.S. is getting peoples attention.

Among the new assets joining Binance include Ethereum Classic and the United States Dollar Coin (USDC), a stable currency backed by Coinbase. Previously, Binance had added both Cardano and Ontology to its system. This comes in the wake of what has arguably been a very harsh year for the cryptocurrency exchange. Recently, the company found itself in hot water when a hacker  allegedly in control of facial photos, private data and other information surrounding many of the exchanges customers  announced on Telegram that the company would see all withheld customer data released to the public if a heavy bitcoin ransom was not paid. There is still speculation regarding whether the threat was valid or not. Binance ultimately issued a statement that placed in doubt whether the information at stake was, in fact, data pertaining to customers operating or trading through Binance. However, this wasnt the first attack centered on the trading platform to occur this year. Several months ago, the company experienced a heavy hit from hackers who potentially stole as much as $40 million in BTC units from its initial reserves. Customer funds seemingly remained unaffected for the most part, and Binance executives later claimed that it had enough to make up for the potential losses. They were, nevertheless, seriously disappointed by the attack. This led to something of a crossroads for bitcoin enthusiasts. On the one hand, the worlds largest and most widely utilized cryptocurrency exchange had lost a big chunk of money. On the other hand, bitcoin  the worlds largest cryptocurrency by market cap  rose by over $1,000 within the next week, exhibiting a level of maturity that many traders and sellers had yet to witness. This latest news leaves many analysts and industry experts wondering if the addition of new coins as of late is a means of Binance attempting to bring trust back to its trading platform. While its unclear what the motivations are, the company is now garnering a little more eyeballing from customers who seek to add more coins to their portfolios and potentially grow richer. They also have new trading pairs to look forward to, such as Litecoin and Ethereum classic against both bitcoin and Tether, an alleged stable coin that has also garnered its fair share of controversy over the years. Bitcoin will also trade against Coinbases USDC. The currency was released late in 2018, with Coinbase and its partner in crime Circle (led by Jeremy Allaire) issuing approximately $1 billion-worth of USDC funds into the crypto arena. Thus far, approximately $600 million of those units have been converted back into traditional monies. ","['Binance', 'Crypto Trading', 'Ethereum Classic', 'litecoin', 'USDC']"

The company, designed for shoppers who are technically efficient and prefer to do all or most of their purchases online, only accepts cryptocurrency payments for merchandise, and turns its back on cash, debit or credit cards. One of the big goals for cryptocurrencies has been to garner enough stamina in the space to be used as payment methods for goods and services. In the end, despite the speculative nature of bitcoin and its altcoin cousins, many are just there if you need to buy groceries or a cup of joe in the morning. Unfortunately, volatility has been a serious problem. Many forms of crypto are prone to massive price swings that can occur without warning. Sometimes this is a good thing; if bitcoin is trading for $11,000 one day, theres a solid chance it can move up to $12,000 with a 24-hour period, but this process also works in reverse. Cryptocurrencies can lose heavy amounts of their volumes in little time. Many of us likely remember bitcoins dilemma in 2018, when after the previous December  in which the currency rose to nearly $20,000 per unit  it spent the next 11 months falling steadily until it had lost more than 70 percent of its overall value and wound up in the mid-$3,000 range by the time Thanksgiving rolled around. As a result, many stores and retailers have said no to accepting crypto payments, given that they are not stable enough, and to an extent, we can understand why theyd feel nervous. If you purchase $45 worth of merchandise with bitcoin, but tomorrow the price of BTC goes down, youll still walk away with the items you bought, but the retailer you purchased them from will wind up losing money. So, its interesting to see a platform like All for Crypto show up. Refuting all traditional forms of payment, the company is asking that customers only pay in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, which is likely to set crypto on a very serious path towards legitimacy. In addition, executives claim All for Crypto will be much more transparent for users than other online shopping websites. William Leen, CEO of All for Crypto, says the company is seeking to alleviate consumers from some of the problem associated with e-commerce sites. He states: There were unhappy sellers who experienced fraudulent chargebacks, and unhappy buyers who never got their products after paying for them. As blockchain and cryptocurrencies became more popular among the masses, I thought there must be a better way to trade online. Then, All for Crypto was born. Blockchain provides irrefutable evidence of transactions. Customers can purchase items on the site with any form of crypto including All for Cryptos own token AFCT.

For the most part, China has had a very mixed relationship with cryptocurrency. Recently, the country implemented a ban of all foreign exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs), citing fears of money laundering and other crime as the primary reason. Furthermore, regulators have spent several years trying to instill a ban on future bitcoin mining, claiming the effects of such mining can seriously hurt the countrys atmosphere. However, this argument has yet to go anywhere and crypto mining is still prominent within Chinas borders. Presently, the protests in Hong Kong are designed to fight against extradition legislation to the Chinese mainland. One of the more serious moments to arise from the protests involved persons refusing to utilize a centralized form of payment known as Octopus. Those protesting do not want to leave a trail of their actions and potentially lead themselves right into authoritative hands. They were also concerned about facial recognition which Octopus utilizes to know its users. These and other issues being faced by protesters on the island has led to whats known as a premium in digital currencies that are traded against the Hong Kong dollar. The currency first began trading for around $160 during mid-June, when the protests first began. Since then, bitcoin has garnered a trading price of about $11,358 at press time, yet the premium is still in play. The reason for this is because the Hong Kong dollar is considered a more unusual or rarer form of cryptocurrency when compared to the yuan. Therefore, it is subject to certain capital controls, which tend to affect whatever asset or currency trades against it. However, bitcoin remains in strong demand on the island nation, suggesting its got a bright future in bringing the protesters the kind of non-controlled environment theyre looking for. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are decentralized, meaning they are not issued by banks or financial institutions. For lack of better terms, financial independence is given to their users in that for money to be offered or received, there are no credit checks, and deposits and withdrawals can be made quickly. Typically, persons depositing money into a standard bank account must wait a day or two before the funds become available. In addition to that, granted they do not have sturdy enough credit, theyre likely to be denied any opportunity for a bank account depending on the institution in question. Citizens living in mainland China cannot trade, sell or purchase bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies on exchanges, which in many ways, is troublesome given how crypto could potentially ease some of the effects of the U.S.-China trade war.

Money laundering and white-collar crimes are a huge concern within the nation of Israel, which seems to be making banks lock up whenever they hear the term crypto. Since Friday, several cryptocurrency traders have reportedly been unable to deposit funds into their digital wallets. Right now, many believe that Israeli banks have concerns regarding know-your-customer (KYC) practices and dont want anything to do with the cryptocurrency business. For the most part, however, it doesnt appear that banks are necessarily anti-crypto or fearful of it. Rather, they are waiting for new rules on how to handle cryptocurrency transactions that have been scheduled to arrive for some time and have yet to show their faces. Last May, the nation declared bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies as assets instead of money. For three months, banks within Israels borders have been waiting for new regulation regarding how to handle cryptocurrencies and have thus far come up empty-handed. Banks do not want to be exposed to financial risk, and so long as the crypto space within Israel comes without a definitive set of rules, traditional institutions do not want to get involved. Legal counsel to the Israeli Bitcoin Association Jonathan Klinger says that banks are being forced to operated under a tight cryptocurrency policy. Deposits are presently unacceptable, and fintech companies are facing similar scrutiny. Hes advising that while banks dont necessarily have to jump into the crypto space headfirst, they do need to start paving the way for customers to at least make basic deposits and withdrawals while they wait. He comments: Cooperation from banks seems almost impossible. These actions might have been made if the policy did not originate from concerns of money laundering, but in order to eliminate competition that the cryptocurrency world has with banks. Former deputy commissioner of the Israeli Tax Authority Gidi Bar Zakay is now the CEO of Bittax. He says that the banks arent really at fault and says that they simply cannot operate within the cryptocurrency space unless they have clear guidance from regulators. Without the right rules in play, they dont want to be responsible for any money laundering cases that emerge. He explains: In the past, crypto-related capital could be transferred to some banks in some cases, but in recent years, the banks tightened their self-policy on businesses or individuals operating in the field. They are now waiting for guidelines from the Bank of Israel. While the cryptocurrency arena has been around for roughly ten years, very few nations have developed appropriate regulation when it comes to handling crypto activity. Thus far, the only country with a full set of established rules is Japan. ","['cryptocurrency regulation', 'Israel', 'Money Laundering']"

As one of the worlds leading hedge fund managers, the man built a name for himself in the digital currency arena by serving as one of cryptos earliest adopters. He has not only made predictions on its price, but has seemingly purchased crypto when, to an extent, nobody else wanted it. Were talking, of course, about when Draper first purchased all the illicit bitcoins garnered by Ross Ulbricht, the notorious developer of the Silk Road dark web platform. When Ulbricht was first caught and imprisoned, the bitcoin stash he had been accumulating for several years was ultimately auctioned off by police authorities. The auctions occurred in three separate rounds, and Draper was the man to dominate the first, purchasing more than $40,000 worth of the cryptocurrency. No doubt hes made a ton of money on the investment since then. At press time, Draper is backtracking a bit on his recent prediction of a $250,000 price for bitcoin by the year 2022. While hes still confident this price will be reached within the next few years, hes now stretching the time domain somewhat by claiming the price could be reached by the first quarter of 2023. This isnt too off the mark from his original prediction, but he wants to ensure his followers are right on top of the action so that should bitcoin fail to reach that initial price within three years, theyll give it a few months of catch up time. In a recent interview, Draper explains his reasoning for the slight change and states: $250,000 by 2022, and Im hedging a little, maybe Q1 of 2023. It may be Q1 of 2023, but it will be [$250,000] before that. Draper also commented that bitcoin, for the time being, is being viewed as something of a safe haven against the potential dealings of the U.S.-China trade war initiated by President Donald Trump. Draper says that more people are viewing cryptocurrency as a means of keeping themselves and their assets safe, and that its no longer just a speculative tool. He comments: You know, its interesting. [Bitcoin] has consolidated more than I thought it would. I thought there would be many more competitors at this point that were really relevant, but people have consolidated toward bitcoin because its decentralized and thats why they get the flack at Facebook for being a centralized currency. In the end, he says people trust bitcoin not only because its the largest form of cryptocurrency, but because its not controlled or issued by any bank or traditional institution. People want to be free from supervision, and bitcoin gives them the financial freedom theyre looking for. ","['bitcoin', 'Tim Draper', 'trade war']"

Since the inception of bitcoin roughly ten years ago, the ideal goal of all cryptocurrency has been to be utilized for the payment of goods and services. In many developing countries, financial institutions are often interceded by corrupt government control or weak infrastructures. This can get in the way of the countries people getting their hands on the credit and other financial tools they need to survive and provide for their families. Unfortunately, one thing has often prevented cryptocurrency from realizing its dream to replace cash, checks and credit cards Its volatility. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and EOS, are typically prone to heavy price swings that have caused the values of these currencies to fall at a moments notice. In 2018, for example, bitcoin entered a very bearish period after reaching its all-time high of roughly $20,000 in December of the previous year. Roughly 11 months later, the currency was trading in the mid-$3,000 range, having lost more than 70 percent of its overall value. These price swings have prevented businesses and enterprises from seeing cryptocurrencies as legitimate. Many, in the end, have refused to accept crypto as a valid form of payment, but Armanino sees the situation very differently. The company has stated that it will accept payments in roughly 1,000 different cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, Ripples XRP, Ethereum and Litecoin. It is now one of the few businesses of its kind to implement these new obligations. Andries Verschelden, a partner at the firm, spoke positively of the transition to crypto acceptance, explaining: With more fintech companies, banks and brokerages exploring ways to mainstream cryptocurrency, it made sense for Armanino to build the infrastructure necessary to accept cryptocurrency payments for what we expect to be a growing form of payment. The firm has also incited plans to grow its proprietary block explorer. This division of Armanino works with several blockchain ventures throughout the United States to obtain wallet details and analyze crypto transactions. It also seeks to design and build digital signature validation tools to perform necessary payment audits and ensure the maximum level of trust among its customers. Verschelden states: As digital asset use and adoption increases and new types of transactions are made, such as security token offerings (STO) on public blockchains, the need for third-party assurance tools continues to grow. Thats where our block explorer and associated tools are already proving value to our internal teams and our clients alike.

As the worlds largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchange, Binance has been a repeated target of the some of the worlds biggest and most prolific cyber thieves, though for the most part, the exchange has done a good job in keep itself and its customers safe. Unfortunately, its security measures were questioned earlier this year when the company fell victim to a hack that saw more than $40 million in BTC units disappear overnight. The hack wasnt an entirely negative event in the sense that bitcoin, rather than fall and struggle as it usually would after such an attack, ultimately spiked by more than $1,000 during a time when the crypto bulls were really beginning to take hold. The currency had begun its sudden and meteoric rise to the top of the financial ladder in early April of this year, but it was after the hack that the currency finally began to garner legitimate respect and notice. For the most part, bitcoin was likely to fall following cyberattacks of such magnitude. Thats certainly what it had done in the past. This time, however, the currency was suggesting a new level of maturity that traders and enthusiasts hadnt witnessed before. The currency jumped in price, which left a lot of people feeling impressed and wondering if, finally, bitcoin had developed a thick-enough skin to play in the big leagues. Despite all this, Binance was still out nearly $40 million, and the hack had allegedly affected not just the companys reserves, but those of individual customers. Executives of the exchange claimed they had enough to make up for the losses, but the attack still left a deep wound. This time, its customer data thats at the center of the problem. The company issued a statement explaining: An unidentified individual has threatened and harassed us, demanding 300 BTC in exchange for withholding 10,000 photos that bear similarity to Binance KYC [know-your-customer] data. We are still investigating this case for legitimacy and relevancy. After refusing to cooperate and continuing with this extortion, this individual has begun distributing the data to the public and to media outlets. Despite this scare, Binance is claiming that there are several inconsistencies regarding customer data and the information that has thus far been released. The statement further claims: At the present time, no evidence has been supplied that indicates any KYC images have been obtained from Binance, as these images do not contain the digital watermark imprinted by our system.

Over the last couple of years, its been really correlated to the U.S. dollar. Weak dollar has been good for bitcoins And its been really correlated to risk markets. This year, its steered away from the dollar because the dollars been strong. Bitcoins been up, which is a real breakage. Its gone negative on correlation to the equity markets. At press time, the granddaddy of all crypto is trading for just shy of $11,700. This is about $100 less than where it stood 24 hours ago, but its still miles better than where it stood early last week. At that time, the currency had taken a somewhat bearish turn and was trading for as low as $9,400, which means bitcoin has added more than $2,000 to its overall price in a relatively short amount of time. Lees description of bitcoin being tied to gold makes sense. Just last Monday, gold rose by approximately two percent in price. The metal has been known not to lose value during times of financial crisis and proved to be one of the most stable assets during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. If gold owns a solid position, its likely bitcoin will as well. Golds sudden rise can likely be attributed to its being viewed as a safe haven of sorts amongst investors. The ongoing trade war between the United States and China is escalating to greater heights, with the U.S. now issuing tariffs on another $300 billion-worth of Chinese items set to take hold in early September of this year. Both gold and bitcoin are being viewed as potential shields against further financial strife during the conflict. However, Lee also commented about the end of the crypto winter, which saw bitcoin and several other forms of cryptocurrency lose anywhere between 70 and 90 percent of their values during the latter half of 2018. Bitcoin, for example, had nearly reached $20,000 per unit by the end of 2017, though by November of the following year, it had fallen to the mid-$3,000 range. Regarding the end of the crypto winter, Lee states: I think that makes [crypto] an authentic institutional source of diversification. I think thats going to help it propel to new heights.

As of late, several new business platforms, such as the PIT, have emerged to take aim at the practice of crypto trading. This is likely attributed to the fact that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been on the rise over the past few months, even though there have been some rough patches dispersed throughout the middle. At press time, for example, bitcoin is trading for a little over $11,700, though it had spiked above $12,000 for the first time since June during todays early morning hours. This can be attributed more to correction activity rather than an inability to move beyond its present position. Bitcoin has been at $11,700 for roughly 24 hours, and the jump to $12,000 followed by the swift fall back to its previous price is not something we havent seen before. Typically, bitcoin and other mainstream forms of crypto are known to fall back slightly following a speedy hike while it works on attaining its new and larger price through long-term measures, rather than simple speculation. Overall, FTX has raised an impressive $8 million to build out its trading platform. The company was founded by Alameda Research, which presently monitors about $100 million in customer assets and enjoys a daily trading volume of approximately $1 billion, making it comparable to Binance, the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchange in the world. FTX is designed more with institutional traders in mind and getting them involved in the world of digital assets trading. Many analysts claim that its these institutional players which will give the crypto arena the legitimacy it needs to survive alongside precious metals, fiat and other investment tools. At the same time, it does offer education and crypto trading to retail players, hoping this will encourage more first-timers to consider adding crypto to their portfolios. Among the leaders of the firms $8 million funding round were blockchain fund Proof of Capital and an official partner of the company Chris McCann; FBG; Galois Capital, and Consensus Lab. CEO of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried commented in a statement: Im personally very passionate about trading, so FTX is a platform built by traders for traders. In creating FTX, I wanted to build a platform for professionals like me, while also bringing crypto trading to the mass market and first-time users. McCann added a few words of his own, explaining: I am thrilled to partner with Sam and his team. His love for trading really shows in their product and Proof of Capital is honored to help the company go to market in Asia. ","['crypto', 'crypto exchange', 'FTX', 'Institutional Traders']"

This is the sentiment of Circle founder Jeremy Allaire, who says that the country could potentially become one of the bigger players in the digital currency market. To say that China has had a mixed relationship with virtual money would be an understatement. The country has outright banned digital currency exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) and is also debating whether to rid itself of bitcoin mining practices due to the potential hazards they present to the environment. However, this is something the country has been going back and forth on for quite some time, and its unclear if regulators plan to take official action. That said, bitcoin is not particularly popular amongst Chinese legislators, which is odd considering how much money its earned from bitcoin mining and similar practices. Bitmain and several other bitcoin mining enterprises have made their homes within Chinas borders, though its been argued that China is potentially looking to release its own digital asset within the next few years, and it doesnt want bitcoin around to disrupt its plans or bring on bouts of heavy competition. China has taken a hardened stance against virtual currency since 2017, though recently, the countrys federal court system recognized bitcoin as digital property. From there, the state-initiated Bank of China began submitting marketing materials centered on bitcoin and digital currencies. Allaire comments: We have been seeing, from my vantage point, a softening in the Chinese stances towards crypto There is a lot of Chinese national participation in this market. There are many large offshore exchanges. One of the reasons for this change could be the growing, global interest in crypto. At the same time, its not off-key to assume that China is looking at cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as a way of offsetting the ongoing trade war between itself and the United States. Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump invoked several billion dollars-worth of tariffs on imported Chinese goods. Trump has commented that China cannot continue to dominate the global market the way it does, as this presents serious threats (i.e. job losses, decreases in home-based manufacturing, etc.) to the U.S. economy. Following the latest announcement that an additional ten percent of tariffs would begin on September 1, China allowed its national currency  the yuan  to slide to its lowest levels. Bitcoin and other forms of crypto could be the answer the country is seeking. At press time, bitcoin has exploded to just shy of $11,800  a near $1,000 gain from the last 24 hours, while traditional stocks are down everywhere thanks to the tariff announcement. This seems to be the running theme with American markets: when stocks fall, BTC and crypto spikes, and when crypto falls, stocks begin to surge higher.

A few hundred dollars more and well be at $12,000, which is where many analysts think the coin is headed next. After a rough few weeks in which bitcoin was battered from all sides (President Donald Trump submitted a barrage of tweets condemning the coin, while Facebooks Libra was hit with a congressional hearing and potential delays), the currency has already risen by more than $2,000 since hitting a new low of $9,400. The currency has managed to remain resilient throughout the last month despite some negative press, and things are really starting to pick up. In just the last 24 hours, the currency rose by roughly $800. Just yesterday, the coin hadnt hit $11,000 and was trading for just over $10,900. Anthony Pompliano, the co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, argues that the currency will likely hit $100,000 by the end of 2021. This basically gives the currency approximately two years to strike six-figure territory and add approximately $89,000 to its overall price. While this may seem like a rough pursuit, Pompliano believes his prediction can come true simply because fiat is starting to lose a lot of credibility. With inflation occurring every ten years, and the risk of economic downturns threatening global economies every two or three years respectively, bitcoin has, as Pompliano has explained in the past, beginning to look more like digital gold. Its upcoming halving event is also likely to send it into a whirlwind of price gains. He explains in a recent interview: Whenever we get to a recessive period or kind of slowing growth, central banks have two tools: they can cut interest rates, which they did yesterday, and they can print money (quantitative easing). And so, when they do both of those things, it usually takes anywhere between six to 18 months to feel the effect of those tools, and what its going to do is its going to coincide with the bitcoin halving. The halving will reduce the number of bitcoins being extracted by half. It is stated that approximately 17 million of the 21 million bitcoin units in existence have been mined, which means bitcoin is about to get a lot more valuable. Pompliano also states that bitcoin has a few advantages over gold: The difference is, between bitcoin and gold, with bitcoin, we know exactly how many are getting created, so 1,800 bitcoins are going to be created today. The second thing is we know the total supply available. So, its not, Hey, I wonder how much is in the ground. We know exactly how much it is, and we can go and audit or verify the software code of the system. ","['Anthony Pompliano', 'bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Gold']"

Whats the big catch? Users will not be able to purchase bitcoin or cryptocurrencies with the card should they hold interest in digital assets. To that, many enthusiasts have a common question on their minds. Hey Apple Jealous, much? One must wonder if the move is potentially inspired by Apples fear of competition. The company has shown interest in cryptocurrencies in the past. In fact, one source suggests that part of the reason bitcoin and other digital currencies have rallied so much this year is because mega-tech companies like Apple and Facebook have shown such interest in them. Now, the I-phone conglomerate wants to take away peoples chances of cashing in on the crypto craze and potentially adding more diversity to their investment portfolios. The reason is because the card is being issued in partnership with Goldman Sachs, the real estate investment enterprise. The company has a secret clause that says the card cannot be used to purchase anything speculative. This includes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, gambling chips, lottery tickets or anything of that nature. It can be argued that this is both understandable and foolish. For one thing, all the items listed above are not set in stone. Theyre not on the same plane as traditional, fiat currency. There is no guarantee with any of them. Crypto, for example, is known for its highly volatile nature. Gambling chips and lottery tickets are just that: gambles, which means people could spend on these items all their lives and get nowhere. One can understand that perhaps Apple and Goldman are trying to protect their customers, but to disallow purchases of these items fully suggests that Apple is trying too hard to solidify itself as a legitimate financial institution, and in that respect, Apple cannot be compared to enterprises like Wells Fargo, Citibank, Capital One or similar businesses. These companies strictly work in finance. Thats all they do, whereas Apple is still more of a retail company, looking to release phones, iPads, computers and similar items. Its a manufacturer, seller and distributor, and if it seeks entry into the financial arena, it will be a secondary venture for the company. The fact is that Apple is trying to hard to be something its not. In the past, companies like Citibank and Capital One have barred customers from using their credit or debit cards to purchase cryptocurrencies through exchanges, but Apple does not have the track record nor the financial status of these companies to make similar maneuvers. The company has clearly profited from the crypto craze in the past, so why cant its customers? ","['Apple', 'bitcoin', 'crypto', 'Goldman Sachs']"

Unfortunately, this little fantasy wont be turned into a reality just yet. The company has taken to several crypto news sites and social media pages to explain that it would be the first clearing house and cryptocurrency exchange to permit such trades in the future. Recently, however, Ledger X has had to backtrack on these statements, claiming that its explanations were premature and that its derivatives wont be ready on time. Such derivatives were designed to bring more retail players into the crypto market. While the project is still possible, delays have come about, and some enthusiasts arent taking the news too well. Even more drastic is how Ledger X initially reacted. Recently, chief executive Paul Chou took to Twitter to hit back at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). His tweets, laden with foul language and notably derogatory words, claimed that the organization was breaking the law and preventing Ledger X from fulfilling duties it had not only promised its customers, but was legally allowed to execute. Chou later retracted some of these statements after the organization got in touch and requested that he censor some of his comments. While Chou deleted some of the tweets, he also expressed his first amendment rights, saying that while his messages may have been rough, they hadnt crossed any lines. This later led to further controversy after the companys public relations representative issued a tweet saying that Chou was no longer involved with Ledger X. CFTC spokesman Michael Short responded to the situation, commenting: Ledger X requested that the CFTC amend their order of registration as a DCO to also include clearing futures listed on its DCM. That process has not yet been completed. The good news is that the fight between both organizations hasnt resulted in any negative press for bitcoin. In fact, the currency is doing quite well at press time, having spiked beyond $10,850 during the early morning hours of Saturday, August 3. This price is a $300+ spike just from yesterday, which saw bitcoin trading at roughly $10,500. Recently, the currency had hit new lows of $9,500 and $9,400, leading many enthusiasts to wonder if perhaps the bull run that began in early April was coming to an end. Ledger X presently focuses primarily on institutional investors and monitors approximately $10 million in assets. The derivatives would have brought more retail customers to Ledger Xs playing field. It is presently open to crypto investors living in both the U.S. and Singapore. ","['bitcoin', 'CFTC', 'Ledger X', 'Paul Chou']"

In the long run, it appears everything has been working in the currencys favor. While President Trump may have tweeted some negative sentiment towards the currency and enthusiasts may have seen it fall to new lows ($9,400 and $9,500), the coin seems to have come back stronger than ever. While Congress may have set its sights on attacking Libra and preventing the development of what is arguably one of the most important cryptocurrencies to emerge within the space over the past five years, bitcoin is still hitting back hard. It seems to be true what so many analysts are now saying Bitcoin has developed a thicker skin. The currency has gained in maturity, and its not likely to let its followers down again they way it did in 2018. Among the reasons for bitcoins sudden and unexpected rise could be the lowering of federal interest rates in the United States. As a means of protecting everyday Americans from the effects of the countrys ongoing trade war with China, the Federal Reserve has sought to lower interest rates down by approximately 0.5 percent. This will be the first time such a maneuver is made since the year 2008. That means that in over ten years, Americans have not seen drops in national interest. Some have argued that the effects of Trumps tariffs are falling onto average citizens, though this argument is lacking evidence. Nevertheless, stock markets are down, and many retailers have either increased prices on China-based products or are seeking goods made within America or its allies. Where Americans do seem to be getting affected is that some items are now less common, meaning they are left looking for alternatives to many of the items they required in everyday life. In the long run, it looks like this federal interest cut may be contributing to bitcoins meteoric rise. Its unknown where these tariffs will take us. Its unknown where America will be in one year or one week, and suddenly items like bitcoin are looking a little more intriguing to those who are concerned about inflation or hits to Americas national currency (USD). With the rate cut, there is now less reason to hold American dollars in ones bank account, so items like BTC appear more suitable. Rate cuts like these reduce yields on certain currencies, in this case USD, and many experts believe that further cuts are likely to occur in the future. Thus, if these moves continue in the coming months, were likely to see bitcoin incur further spikes. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'federal interest', 'rate cuts']"

A recent analysis submitted by the countrys Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID) suggests that the best cryptocurrency available today is EOS, while bitcoin was much further down the list. As mentioned, EOS earned the top spot, while its primary competitor and parent cryptocurrency Ethereum garnered the number two position. Despite several problems, TRON earned third place, but bitcoin didnt even earn a spot in the top ten. Its hard to imagine what the country seemingly has against bitcoin. For one thing, its the oldest form of crypto out there, and while its technology isnt quite up there with Ethereums or EOS (bitcoin transfers typically occur within a few days, while Ethereum and EOS transfers are said to take only minutes), it holds the biggest market cap and the most space for traders given its 21 million units (of which three million still arent in circulation). Several analyses show that while bitcoin is old, its still king and holds the most trust among crypto traders, so why would China place it in such a low position? Bitcoin came in 11th place, primarily because its development is considered relatively slow when compared with the prospects of other competing cryptocurrencies. Steem, for example, is still a relatively new type of digital asset, yet earned position number four on the list given its status as a wild social media experiment that took heavy risks when coming to fruition. In addition, Zilliqa  one of the first cryptocurrencies to undergo the sharding process  also earned a higher position than bitcoin. One could argue that bitcoin doesnt take that many chances, but the fact is that it remains a solid blockchain in that it works to ensure all crypto transfers are recorded and remain accurate. Bitcoin is trying to be the cryptocurrency that survives all odds by not taking that many risks, and thus far, its stood the test of time. Its ten years old and doesnt appear to be disappearing anytime soon. Furthermore, bitcoin has not fallen victim to corporate influence and has refused to allow businesses to be built on its blockchain, unlike competitors such as Ethereum, XRP and Zcash. As Live Bitcoin News has reported in the past, China could also be out to dismiss bitcoin entirely because the country recognizes it boasts the highest level of competition. The nation has long claimed to be looking into building its own national cryptocurrency, but systems like bitcoin and now Libra have long proven to be far more popular and compelling with crypto enthusiasts, and regulators within Chinas government are starting to feel the pressure. In addition, the country says its looking into banning bitcoin mining in the future. ","['bitcoin', 'china', 'EOS', 'Ethereum']"

Sources claim it is one of the largest cryptocurrency transfers to occur in the history of the space. In all, Grayscale is expected to transfer more than $3 billion in assets to Coinbases platform. The transfer will occur in less than 12 hours, making it the largest single-day move of its kind. The company claims to be the worlds largest bitcoin and digital currency asset manager. Among the currencies being moved to Coinbase Custody are bitcoin, bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripples XRP. Sam McIngvale, the chief executive of Coinbase Custody, explained in an interview: Grayscale and Coinbase have led the way in providing safe, secure, trustworthy and regulated access to digital assets. Grayscale is an established, trusted and valuable partner to its clients and its service providers should be the same. As a NY State-chartered trust company, Coinbase Custody is held to the same fiduciary standards as national banks. We also offer some of the broadest and deepest insurance coverage in the crypto industry. The maneuver is even more important in the sense that Coinbase Custody is, as stated in the quote, based in New York, which has long been labeled a dismal area for cryptocurrency thanks to its BitLicense requirements. All crypto-based companies seeking to do business in the blockchain space are required to adhere by the rules set forth by New Yorks BitLicense. The document requires several additional fees for said businesses, which are considered blockades of innovation. As a result, many crypto-based enterprises in the past have packed up and said good-bye to the Big Apple. Greyscales new partnership with the platform may be contributing to the sudden rise of bitcoin, which spiked as much as $500 during the early morning hours of August 2. A news report by cryptocurrency firm Digital Delphi says that bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts can expect the asset to surge even further in the coming weeks. In addition, it also states that global GDPs are expected to fall, while inflation and looser monetary policies are set to take precedence during the remainder of 2019, thereby boosting bitcoins current prospects. The report explains: A key reason behind bitcoins outperformance in recent months is the strengthening narrative around its value proposition as digital gold. The macro backdrop thats emerging is the perfect storm for bitcoin to thrive as it has the potential to benefit from both secular and cyclical trends in the coming years Global PMIs, GDP growth forecasts and inflation expectations are all trending lower, which helps support the case for looser monetary policy.

At press time, the currency is trading for well over $10,500, and it seems the currency has shot up by more than $500 during the early morning hours of Friday, August 2. This is especially pleasing to the eye considering how poorly bitcoin has been doing as of late. Recently, the currency fell to as low as $9,400 after being hit from every corner by negative sentiment. The first came in the form of tweets submitted by President Donald J. Trump, who became the first sitting U.S. president to address the existence of crypto and offer an opinion on it. If only that opinion had been a little more positive. Instead, Trump mentioned that he didnt really care for bitcoin or its crypto cousins given that they werent real money and that their values were based on thin air. From there, Libra  Facebooks new cryptocurrency  was struck by a congressional hearing following several weeks of back and forth arguments between members of the U.S. government and David Marcus, the head of Facebooks blockchain division. Congress ultimately asked that Marcus and his team hold off on developing Libra further until they could better understand the goals, properties and ideals of the coin. Marcus has had no choice but to concede, and now it appears Libra is going to be delayed for at least two years. However, its being suggested that negative publicity is better than none, and bitcoin is swelling quickly as a result. A new report from Delphi Digital acknowledges that bitcoin is rising fast and discusses some of the additional elements that could potentially be contributing to is sudden spike. The report claims that monetary easing is occurring in many nations as several countries are preparing for what could turn out to be a period of economic strife, though a recession has not yet been confirmed by analysts. The report states: First, and arguably most important, sentiment from global central banks took a drastic turn towards more dovish monetary policies. The Fed, ECB, BOJ PBOC and many others are now preparing market participants for more rate cuts and additional stimulus features as they attempt to keep the current economic expansion going. The idea is to keep the global economy booming and continue with the creation of new jobs and tasks so that citizens remain unaffected by potential downturns in the monetary system. Should this occur, bitcoin is in a prime position to spike even higher. The report says: The rising risk of currency devaluation, especially among reserve currencies, is a longer-term catalyst that should propel BTC higher along with gold The global slowdown everyone feared was on the horizon has begun to show up in the economic data as well.

Despite a few price drops over the past two weeks, the currency, by comparison to where it stood just a year ago, is doing extremely well. The asset began its meteoric rise in April of this year, spiking well beyond the $5,000 point during that month and continuing its jumps into higher territory ever since. However, when something becomes really rock solid like that, many members of the public may feel a little too inclined to get involved. This is exactly what former hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz says is happening with bitcoin. In a recent interview, Novogratz compared bitcoin to the Beyond Meat hype that occurred roughly two months ago. The company  which sought to reduce the amount of meat consumption in America by introducing users to plant-based substitutes such as soy products  ultimately did quite well in the beginning. People bought the hype, believing that the products being marketed were healthier and safer for their bodies. However, its probably safe to say that too many individuals became involved, and when too many people purchase stakes in a company like that, its likely to become too heavy with the influence of its investors. The company held an IPO in May of this year. During that time, stocks hit a new high of more than $208 per share. Thats a 70 percent increase from where they stood before. Unfortunately, stocks have begun to stumble badly following the announcement of a secondary IPO, in which stock will be offered at approximately $160 per share. This is a discount of nearly 20 percent, and stocks are now trading for approximately $30 less than where they stood before. Is it possible the same thing is happening with bitcoin? After all, the currency nearly rose to $14,000 in late June, but has since continued to stumble further and further south, ultimately hitting the $9,400 mark  its lowest position in more than a month. Novogratz thinks that bitcoin suddenly became intriguing to everyone again. Everybody bought in, and now the currency is struggling to maintain its position under all that investor weight. He comments: Beyond Meat reminds me a little bit of crypto You get great bubbles on big ideas. This is a great bubble Everyone gets sucked in All the young guys on their Robinhood accounts are buying this. This is their crypto. Novogratz doesnt go into detail about what path he sees bitcoin taking in the coming weeks or months, but we can likely assume that the currency will stay as it is for some time. To incur such a heavy rise would no doubt require a lengthy correction of sorts, which is exactly what bitcoin seems to be doing as of late.

Make Up Your Mind!']"," Something strange is going down in Russia regarding bitcoin mining machines. The Federal Customs Service is investigating a potential scam involving bitcoin miners. The agency alleges that approximately 6,000 mining machines have been shipped to Russia, and that customs fees were not paid on any of the units. The culprit at large is reportedly the Far-East Trading and Industrial Company, also known as DTPK. According to authorities, the enterprise may owe as much as $1.2 million USD in fees to the customs association. The miners allegedly shipped to the company include Bitmain ASIC minders such as the Ant Miner S9-13.5, the L3+ and the D3. DTPK is also being accused of creating fake documents that include altered or fixed prices for the mining machines. In addition, it is stated in an official report that DTPK may have lied about which company supplied the miners. DTPK is saying the machines were garnered from MSR, a mining business stationed in Korea, though the company did not have a contract with DTPK. Authorities believe DTPK may have obtained the mining machines between the dates of August 2017 and February 2018. Thus, these miners were being shipped to the enterprise for roughly six months. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining have become something of a conundrum in most countries. In Venezuela, for example, bitcoin mining isnt necessarily illegal, but it does come with some very heavy restrictions, and with President Maduro pushing for Petro use every chance he gets, many miners report series of harassments or intimidation to potentially rid them of their businesses and mining goals. China is also examining the prospects of ridding the country of all future mining enterprises given that it potentially does harm to the atmosphere. To be fair, however, this is something China has been looking at for quite some time, but its never made a move. Iran, on the other hand, has recently declared bitcoin mining fully legal within the country, though this may be because legislators are looking for ways to possibly bypass current U.S.-based sanctions. Thus, cryptocurrency use is looking quite intriguing as of late. Police authorities in Russia also took a swipe at a company called Intelion Mining, confiscating approximately 2,500 units of mining equipment given that they were potentially grey imports. This means that the units were shipped illegally and did not garner customs payments. Intelion Mining says it has never engaged in the process of crypto mining before. Russia has had a relatively mixed relationship with cryptocurrencies, going back and forth when it comes to instilling a full ban on crypto use. However, the country has hinted that its looking to introduce a digital ruble  the nations official cryptocurrency  sometime in the future, suggesting that a ban on bitcoin could be an attempt to stifle competition.

The concern began a few weeks ago when President Donald Trump tweeted his dislike for cryptocurrencies, saying that they werent real money and that their values were based on thin air. In addition, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed that heavy regulation was coming in the U.S. for digital assets, and Libra has been getting the evil eye from Congress since Facebook first submitted its plans for the currency. With all this in mind, its hard to assume that the U.S. is friendly or trusting of crypto, but many analysts say enthusiasts in the U.S. dont have much to worry about, as it would be very difficult for American regulators to initiate a ban of cryptocurrencies anytime soon. Interestingly, this isnt just the sentiment of cryptocurrency traders and experts, but of the lawmakers themselves. The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs recently held a hearing on blockchain and cryptocurrency regulation. It was here where Chairman Mike Crapo  a republican representative from Idaho  stated that the U.S. would not be successful if it were to try and instill a cryptocurrency ban. He states: If the United States were to decide  and Im not saying that it should  if the United States were to decide we dont want cryptocurrency to happen and tried to ban it, Im pretty confident we couldnt succeed in doing that because this is a global innovation. The idea is that blockchain and cryptocurrencies are being developed and utilized all over the world. Thus, the United States would never be able to oppress all future innovation in this department and granted enthusiasts within the U.S. really wanted to get their hands on these assets, they ultimately could with little or no supervision through other regions. CEO of Circle Jeremy Allaire shares this sentiment. He says that bitcoin and its crypto cousins have given birth to an entirely new reality thats designed to shift focus and power from government bodies and back into the hands of private equity traders, and that it cannot be controlled the way traditional fiat can. He says: I think the challenge that we all face with this is some of these cryptocurrencies  theyre literally just a piece of open-source software. Theres nothing else. It exists on the internet, its open-source software. Anyone can implement it, it runs wherever the internet runs, and these have a monetary policy where these assets are algorithmically generated That is a challenge that every government in the world now faces. That money, digital money, will move everywhere in the world at the speed of the internet. ","['bitcoin', 'Bitcoin Ban', 'Jeremy Allaire', 'Mike Crapo']"

This is excellent news considering yesterday the coin was trading in the $9,600 range. Granted it was high in that range, anytime bitcoin sinks below $10,000 isnt likely to go over well with enthusiasts. Bitcoin has had it hard over the past few weeks with the likes of President Donald Trumps tweets regarding how its allegedly not real money and the congressional hearing of Libra, the cryptocurrency being developed by Facebook. But now it looks like the currency is beginning to retrace its steps. Bitcoin has shown us time and time again that its quite resilient. It may stay down for some time, but it will never stay down forever. The currency always manages to pull itself out of the gutter and hoist itself beyond a certain position on the financial ladder, and it appears to be doing so again. While its hard to say how long this behavior will last, bitcoin has indeed developed greater maturity over the last year and is proving that maturity to its fans. Now, many members of Wall Street are beginning to see the currency in a new light and are predicting massive boosts for its price within the coming years. One source compiled the predictions of several Wall Street leaders, and many believe that bitcoin could reach a price of $100,000 per unit by the year 2021. Wouldnt that be a sight for sore eyes? Less than a year-and-a-half to go before 2021 gets here, and many analysts already think bitcoin could hit the six-figure mark by that time. Thats true power for something like bitcoin. Among those contributing to this prediction is Peter Brandt, a veteran commodities trader. At 72 years of age, Brandt has been involved in the world of investing for some time, and recently made the case for a serious bitcoin bull run in a series of tweets, in which he states: Bitcoin takes aim at $100,000 target. $BTCUSD is experiencing its fourth parabolic phrase dating back to 2010. No other market in my 45 years of trading has gone parabolic on a log chart in this manner. Bitcoin is a market like no other. Paul Chou, the CEO of Ledger X, goes even further with his prediction, and thinks bitcoin could spike to $100,000 earlier than his counterparts, suggesting December 2020 for the time of bitcoins sudden ascension. This would occur right after the presidential election. He claims: Dozens of these institutions go back to us saying wed be interested in trading a contract like this. I understand $100,000 is a large number, but a lot of us whove been in this space remember bitcoin at $1. Then it hit $10 and $100 and $10,000. A $100,000 contract doesnt even make us blink.

This is a question that seems to haunt many crypto enthusiasts and traders everywhere, and as time moves along, it seems the walls are closing in certain respects. For example, U.S. President Donald Trump recently issued a barrage of tweets bashing bitcoin and crypto in general, saying that digital assets were not real money and that their values were based on thin air. In addition, Facebooks new Libra cryptocurrency seems to have everyone rather worried. Following a congressional hearing that saw Facebooks head of blockchain development David Marcus in the hotseat, many members of Americas Congress requested that the social media conglomerate hold off on its plans to develop Libra further until they can get all their questions answered. Marcus and the remainder of the Libra staff have reluctantly agreed. As of late, bitcoin has been tumbling and is now trading for just shy of $9,700. This is small beans when compared to the $13,600 it was trading for just last month. It may seem like the United States is bringing down the house on crypto, but according to one source, the real power lies in the hands of Japan, not the U.S. Japan is arguably the most influential region when it comes to cryptocurrency use, and so long as the country sees a valid need for bitcoin and its crypto counterparts, digital assets are likely to survive. Japan has been one of the most open-minded nations when it comes to virtual money. The country declared bitcoin a legal payment option in 2017, thereby dubbing it an official currency of Japan. Regulators have also integrated strong know-your-customer (KYC) tactics and many other protocols designed to lessen the problems associated with crypto hacks and other malicious activity. At the same time, the country remains vulnerable to many problems. Perhaps the biggest one is its island neighbor North Korea. Kim Jong-un has allegedly garnered more than half-a-million USD in crypto funds by initiating cyberattacks on exchanges through crypto-jacking efforts. Among the most vulnerable countries is Japan, though Kim has potentially targeted several regions in Asia and abroad. Japan has also raised an eyebrow or two regarding the integration of Libra. Regulators say they are open-minded when it comes to Libra and feel it has its benefits, commenting: Users would find [Libra] useful in making international money transfers because it would be cheaper than the current system. Unfortunately, in the same conversation, they also revealed that they have doubts about Libras reliability. At this stage, Japan doesnt seem to be shying away from cryptocurrency any time soon, but stronger regulation appears to be making its way into the countrys financial system at every step, which could potentially lead crypto into a greater period of stability.

While this is small beans in comparison to where it stood during early and mid-June, the currency is slowly beginning its ascension back to the top of the financial ladder. Recently, the currency fell to as low as $9,400, largely in part to President Donald Trumps negative tweets regarding cryptocurrencies and the ongoing congressional hearing involving David Marcus and Libra. The fact that its already risen another $300 is a good sign, though its clearly taking its time. The currency isnt spiking as quickly as it was last month, suggesting that the currency may have potentially undergone a serious correction and that it is no longer being subjected to the same market trends or speculation. At the same time, we may continue to witness more rises in the coming weeks and months, with countries like Australia remaining indirectly bullish about the currency and what it can do. The Australian government recently issued new draft legislation that would only allow transactions of up to 10,000 in AUD to occur without their being reported to the countrys tax authorities. The move is designed to prevent tax evasion and other illicit activity within the country. In many ways, rules like these could potentially lead Australia  and other countries that follow similar rules  to become cashless societies. In Australia, 10,000 AUD is only equal to about $6,900 USD. When you think about it, thats not much money. Every time a car is purchased, or a home, or maybe a motorbike or even a nice mattress to improve ones sleeping patterns, that persons financial data is likely to be intercepted. Is that fair? Who knows, but the idea of consistently being spied upon for using ones national currency could stir a lot of people in a different direction. No one wants to be spied upon; in addition, no one wants their privacy violated. Thus, we could potentially see a lot more Australians turning to bitcoin and general cryptocurrencies to get what they want and need. Australia is also not initiating anything new. Many other countries within Europe, for example  such as France, Portugal and Spain  have enforced heavy limits on using cash when one is purchasing goods or services. With so many countries seeking to prevent the use of cash, is it possible that bitcoin and other altcoins are about to surge in popularity? CEO of Abra Bill Barhydt also explains that many countries are going to have a difficult time banning bitcoin or limiting its use if theyre potentially planning to tackle it next. Bitcoins properties are designed to thwart government takedowns, and many regulators do not have any kind of authority over bitcoin in the first place.

This is likely a question on several crypto enthusiasts minds, as the granddaddy of all crypto cant seem to stop falling further down the financial ladder. At press time, the crypto unit is trading for just over $9,400  the lowest its been in several weeks. What the heck happened? Just last month the bitcoin price was at a whopping $13,600. What would make it fall so easily? As Live Bitcoin News has covered recently, U.S. President Donald Trump had a few unflattering things to say about bitcoin and its crypto counterparts, claiming that they werent real money and that their values were based on thin air. It appears bitcoin hasnt established as thick a skin as we originally thought, though to be fair, its likely the currency would have taken a harsher lashing from words like these three or even two years ago. In addition, controversy continues to surround Facebooks Libra currency. The competing unit  which David Marcus and his team allege will be a stable currency  has been hit left and right by members of Congress who claim the currency isnt safe and want more information before the company can continue its development plans. For now, it looks like Libra is going to be delayed at least another two years until they get their answers. All this is likely taking a massive toll on the currency, but there are those that refuse to believe it will break. This is a short bump in the road the unit is encountering, but its not likely to bend until it snaps. Dan Morehead is the CEO of Pantera Capital. He still has high hopes for bitcoin and suggests the currency could potentially spike as high as $42,000 by the end of the year. He states: A small kernel of something very important gets people to be crazed about [bitcoin] and then the trough of disillusionment [occurs], and weve already gone through two of those cycles in the six years that weve been investing in it. Where he thinks people may be confused is in the idea that bitcoin is an established technology. He says that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are likely to require a minimum of 20 full years before they truly get off the ground, and thus far, were only halfway there (bitcoin emerged in 2009). Still, hes confident that growing user interest will propel bitcoin forward, and that it could pass $300,000 within the next three years: Were always trying to look three to five years out and be thinking about where the industry will be rather than worrying about these kinds of manic phases of bubbles and then the crypto winters where everyone thinks its never going to work.

While the digital assets have grown in popularity over the years, they have come with their fair share of problems. Bitcoin, for example, has become increasingly popular since the fall of the nations currency the bolivar. Inflation is at its highest point, and many within Venezuela find themselves struggling to purchase most necessities, such as clothing and food for their children. Supermarket shelves are practically bare, and many have resorted to attacking zoo animals to put meat on their tables. Attempting to thwart the growing poverty, the country has issued its own national cryptocurrency called the Petro. Making its official debut in early 2018, the currency allegedly earned nearly a billion dollars from its initial coin offering (ICO), though these claims have come with a few raised eyebrows. Perhaps the most questionable statement comes in the form of the Petro being backed by the nations many oil supplies. Some sources say this is not true, as there is no mention of this in the Petros whitepaper. There have been so many controversies surrounding the Petro that U.S. President Donald Trump ultimately banned all Petro trading last year, warning that all who dealt in it were likely to face legal consequences. Still, President Maduro of Venezuela continues to push the Petro, and even introduced a plan that would ensure all working men and women in the country would receive their paychecks not in the doomed bolivar, but in the ever-growing Petro. For the most part, however, the Petro has seriously failed to catch on, and many in Venezuela are still resorting to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to earn their place in society and garner what they need. This hasnt always gone over well with government authorities, and some bitcoin miners allege theyve been attacked and threatened by police and financial regulators in Venezuela who seek to shut them down. One such miner goes by the name of Juan Blanco, who recently took to social media to tell his followers that the Venezuelan government has used what he calls intimidation tactics repeatedly to close his operation. Many times, they have allegedly tried to make off with his mining equipment. In addition, he says that they have even tried to steal his earnings. While bitcoin mining is legal in Venezuela, the practice comes with some rather heavy restrictions. Blanco says that authorities ultimately warned him as there was a serious lack of invoices for his company and that his company wasnt properly registered  something that appears to be a serious problem in Venezuela given the rigid laws surrounding the registration process. Blanco says hes worried that such tactics mark just the beginning of a whats to be a period of long and heavy harassment. ","['bitcoin', 'Bolivar', 'Petro', 'venezuela']"

The civil case, which is occurring in Northern California, is against BTC-e, a Russian exchange, and one its owners, Alexander Vinnik. The case alleges that Vinnik may have violated the Bank Secrecy Act. Attorneys for the defendants say he potentially stole bitcoin units from several other exchanges in 2017. They are now pushing for a criminal case, though its unlikely this will hold sway in court. Thus, the suit is for penalties, damages and repayment of all the currency that was ultimately taken to ensure all monies are accounted for. At present, BTC-e has offices in both Seychelles (Africa) and Cyprus (Europe), though its customers exist from all over the world including California. Vinnik was ultimately found in Greece and detained by U.S. authorities who sought to charge him with running an illegal exchange that may have allowed criminals to hide their funds and launder billions of dollars-worth of illicitly obtained currency. Per analyst firm Elliptic, regulators were able to track some of these illegal bitcoins to a user going by the name of Fancy Bear. It is alleged that this is one of the secret Russian operatives that released Democrats emails in the 2016 election. Vinnik is presently in prison, though hes facing extradition requests from both Russia and the U.S. His lawyers are attempting to fight both requests as his jail term was extended by another six months. Lawsuits like these are becoming more and more common, and suggest that perhaps regulators, financial institutions and the general public now see cryptocurrencies as more legit forms of money that deservingly hold a place with USD, gold and other forms of reliable assets. Recently, a judge allowed a multi-million-dollar suit against cell phone and internet provider AT&T to move forward after cryptocurrency investor and entrepreneur Michael Terpin lost several million dollars-worth of crypto funds following a SIM-swapping incident. Terpin alleges that a hacker stole crypto funds through his phone by bribing an AT&T employee for his private data. Terpin says that AT&T did not do enough to protect his information or keep his identity secure. He also alleges that he was the victim of two separate SIM-swapping attacks that ultimately led to his losses. AT&T is fighting the allegations and says it is not responsible for the actions against Terpin, though a federal judge in Los Angeles, CA sees things very differently. In allowing the lawsuit to go forward, the court is issuing a message to crypto holders everywhere that while crypto is an emerging technology, their privacy and funds will be taken into consideration as much as those who potentially lose fiat to bad actors, thereby solidifying the legitimacy of crypto even further.

This is a topic that the nation has gone back and forth on for well over a year. Regulators are now initiating a proposal that would see all cryptocurrency-based activity receive a full ban within the countrys borders, while utilizers of cryptocurrencies would receive up to ten years in prison. This is scary to say the least, not only because people face potential jail time, but because India is likely to cut itself out of some major competition in the future should it decide to initiate such a ban. India is a nation strife with economic struggle, partly because of its ever-growing population. It is now being reported that that population will overtake Chinas within the next few years, which means there stands to be even more people who miss out on potential financial stability. Its true that cryptocurrencies are still hugely volatile. Bitcoin, for example, has fallen from $13,600 to about $9,900 over the last month, but when so many people stand to miss out on traditional financial opportunities due to lagging credit or other necessities, sometimes crypto is the best option one will find. After all, if crypto requires no credit check, payments can be made quickly and people can receive money in their accounts in mere minutes, there are far more benefits to be had. Where India is succeeding, however, is in its recognition of blockchain. Many regulators look down on cryptocurrencies themselves but acknowledge that blockchain technology certainly has potential. A new legislative report discussing the potential crypto ban issues the following statement: The DLT-based systems can be used by banks and other financial firms for processes such as loan-issuance tracking, collateral management, fraud detection and claims management in insurance, and reconciliation systems in the securities market. Economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg echoes this sentiment and explained in a tweet that while India is right to arguably ban crypto, it cannot ignore the power of blockchain. He states: The committee is very receptive and supportive of distributed ledger technologies and recommends its widespread use in delivering financial services. It also opens the door for a possible official digital rupee. Private crypto currencies are of no real value. Rightly banned. His tweet raises concern, however, with the possibility of a digital rupee. As the national currency of the region, the rupee, should it be digitized, will likely be issued by banks and traditional financial enterprises, meaning that the currency is sure to remain centralized. This goes against the ideals of crypto and may not prevent future financial breakdowns. ","['blockchain', 'crypto', 'india']"

At 69 years of age, Miller knows a thing or two about investing, and ultimately launched his hedge fund about three years ago. Since then, it has risen about 46 percent. That means the numbers it originally started with have nearly doubled. Among his top stocks include ADT Inc., Amazon and Avon Products, but Miller has also bet heavily on bitcoin, which took his fund higher than he originally anticipated. After all, bitcoin has been on the rise since April of this year, and at press time, has nearly doubled what it stood at roughly three months ago. Miller commented that the market is rising at a modest rate, and he predicts both stocks and cryptocurrencies are looking good during the latter half of the year. He states: With the economy growing modestly, the Fed about to embark on an easing cycle and inflation quiescent, the extreme diversion in valuations between bond proxies such as utilities and consumer staples and cyclical value stocks, is likely to begin reversing. This represents an excellent opportunity for investors to earn excess returns. While Miller has refused to comment on just how much the fund is worth at press time or how its doing, its estimated that the fund encompasses over $126 million in assorted assets. Miller also oversees a separate $2.3 billion through a Baltimore-based association. Cryptocurrencies have left enthusiasts feeling a little dazed and confused this year. For the most part, bitcoin  the granddaddy of crypto  has been doing well when compared with its performance in 2018, but its still suffering from volatile points here and there. For example, after jumping to $5,000 in April, it continued to gain steadily until reaching roughly $13,600 just last month. However, at press time, following several negative press points including Trumps tweets regarding bitcoin being not real money and a congressional hearing for Libra and Facebook blockchain head David Marcus, it seems bitcoin has taken a turn for the worse. This is the third time in just a few weeks where bitcoin has dropped below the $10,000 level, though at the time of writing, it is well over $9,900, suggesting $10K may once again be around the corner. Miller himself has fallen victim to this volatility over the past month. For one thing, his fund ultimately surged just shy of 40 percent last June but fell nearly 30 percent in the month prior. This is largely because the fund uses one to three times leverage on its investments. In addition, the fund grew by more than 180 percent in 2017, but ultimately fell by around 34 percent last year when the stock market experienced several unexpected drops.

What kind of person would reschedule or potentially skip out on such an opportunity? Well, someone who was allegedly too sick to go or held against their will. The latter was being reported by Chinese news outlet Caixin, which stated that Sun  the chief executive of TRON  was being held in China over accusations of illegal fundraising, gambling, money laundering and pornography activities. Sun, who boasts a massive social media presence (he has over 1.4 Twitter followers alone) immediately took to his pages to announce that the story wasnt true. Rather, he was dealing with kidney stones and was not in a healthy enough state to attend the meeting. That said, hes currently working to reschedule the lunch with Buffett quickly, as he doesnt want to miss this chance. Sun has explained in the past that he wants to use the opportunity to turn a non-believer into a true follower. Buffett, as every crypto enthusiast knows, is no fan of bitcoin, and has even compared the currency to rat poison in the past. He has called it a delusion and swears that it is likely to bring the financial space to its knees. Buffett is not the only major American businessman to house this idea. President Donald Trump, who prior to his time in politics made a name for himself by buying up and renovating half the buildings in lower Manhattan in the 70s, 80s and 90s, recently submitted a massive barrage of tweets explaining that cryptocurrencies were not real money and that their values were based on thin air. He said that the only currency with real value in America was the U.S. dollar. Sun, on the other hand, has made his living with cryptocurrency. As the founder of TRON, Sun says that hes hoping he can use the lunch to speak with Buffett and potentially talk some sense into him. He wants to use the time to explain bitcoins benefits and properties that place it in the financial revolution category rather than the disruptor category. The lunch will not simply be a small meeting between the two business greats. Sun has stated that he will invite a full-court press to attend the lunch so that reporters and guests alike can see what will be discussed and what the outcome should be. In addition, he has asked that Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and e-Toro founder and CEO Yoni Assia also attend. He has also commented that he intends to give Buffett a smartphone filled to the brim with cryptocurrencies, predominantly bitcoin and Litecoin. To put it plainly, Buffetts conversion would certainly make him a great addition to the crypto family. ","['Justin Sun', 'TRON', 'Warren Buffett']"

BTC could accelerate losses and it might even break the $9,000 support in the near term. This week, bitcoin price failed to gain momentum above the $10,800 and $11,000 resistances against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair topped near the $11,108 level and recently started a fresh decline. The pair broke many important supports, including $10,500 and $10,200. As a result, the price moved into a bearish zone below $10,000 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). The price even broke the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $9,085 low to $11,108 high. The current price action is bearish below $10,000, suggesting more losses in the near term. An immediate support is near the $9,550 level. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $9,085 low to $11,108 high might also act as a support. If there are more losses below the $9,550 and $9,500 levels, the price is likely to revisit the $9,085 swing low. In the mentioned case, the price could even break the $9,000 support level. The next key support could be near the $8,600 level. It represents the 1.236 Fib extension level of the upward move from the $9,085 low to $11,108 high. On the upside, there are a key resistances forming near $10,000. Moreover, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $10,080 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. To start a decent recovery, the pair needs to climb above the trend line and $10,100. The main resistance is near the $10,350 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).  Looking at the chart, bitcoin price is clearly under a lot of pressure below $10,000. Therefore, there is a risk of more downsides below the $9,500 support. If the bears remain in action, the price could even break the $9,000 support level in the coming days. 4 hour MACD  The MACD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. 4 hour RSI (Relative Strength Index)  The RSI is currently well below the 40 level, with a bearish angle.

According to a recent report published in Forbes, approximately 75 percent of the data presented on Coin Market Cap is not real. Many cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, provide fake trading volumes to analysis websites, but the problem is that Coin Market Cap is still reporting this information as though it were real. The news may allegedly be hitting bitcoin and other forms of crypto hard at press time. The granddaddy of virtual currency has once again fallen below the $10,000 line. It is currently trading for $9,942, which is still relatively high in comparison to its last drop to the $9,000 range, but its nowhere near where most traders would like to see it. In addition, the drop has occurred in incremental stages. The currency was falling roughly $100 every few hours or so on July 22, and even started the day off at a measly $10,200+, meaning there wasnt much room for the currency to go from the start. Coin Market Cap first acknowledged the fake data being presented on its site roughly four months ago through a series of tweets in March. The company stated: Were working hard to build constructive solutions to address volume concerns. We look forward to more suggestions as we build our tools for our users. However, one would assume that in all this time, the problem would at least be halfway fixed. Unfortunately, that doesnt seem to be the case. Coin Market Cap is still allegedly reporting incorrect information and offering up sweet little statements about how it plans to tackle the issue. Carylyne Chan, the chief strategy officer at the company, explains that the issue of fake volume reporting is very real, and despite the lack of maneuvers thus far, she assures the sites visitors that they are doing all they can to fix the problem. She comments: The team is trying to do it right Its always been balancing between doing it right rather than doing it quickly The team has received just one complaint so far for BKEX and will be further monitoring before an alert will be put up on the site. The real problem here, however, is that many other analysis sites have already fixed their information and reporting structures to ensure correct data is provided, so why is Coin Market Cap taking so long? Chan states: This is really a philosophical question for us because ever since we started the site, we try not to censor information A primary object is not to weed out and ignore data points but really to enrich the decision-making process of our users by publishing a wider array of data points.

Seriously, this is a cryptocurrency being developed by a company that has shown several times it doesnt care about peoples privacy or well-being. If it can sell your information to third parties and get away with it, it will. This was the case involving Cambridge Analytica. The news was discovered in 2018, but the partnership between the two companies had been going for several years. Despite this, Libra is garnering substantial interest from members of the crypto-going public. So much in fact, that the currency has already surpassed Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin in terms of general knowledge. Per a survey conducted by cryptocurrency firm e-Toro, several people were asked to discuss their knowledge of cryptocurrency and a staggering 16 percent already knew what Libra was. This number surpasses that of several other mainstream forms of crypto including Ethereum and Ripples XRP. Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director of e-Toro, comments: We believe that crypto and the blockchain technology that underpins it will be essential to tomorrows economy. By introducing the concept to a new audience, Libra could play a vital role in the evolution of decentralized and more democratized finance. The only problem is that Facebook hasnt shown itself to be democratized. Libra is going to be run by a board of billion-dollar financial companies including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal. How is that for democratized or even decentralized? The one piece of hope we can hang onto is that bitcoin garnered 54 percent in the survey, meaning its still the king. More people have heard of bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency, and it could be the one card we have to pay against Libra and the still incomprehensible agenda behind it. How can people show substantial interest in a currency being developed by a company that has put profit ahead of peoples well-being so many times? This leads to many other questions, such as, Why are people still continuing to use Facebook in the first place? Wasnt the Senate grilling of Mark Zuckerberg last year enough to convince them that this is a dark enterprise set on taking all it can from its users? The problem is that people just arent thinking enough. Everyone complains about what happens or how things are, yet they refuse to do anything different to ensure these problems change. Americans, for example, complain that the costs of universities are too high, yet students continue to accept loans like nothing and attend as if on auto-pilot status. If students suddenly decided they werent going to attend until costs were lowered and they all stuck to this plan, colleges would have no choice but to change themselves. Otherwise, they would garner no attendees and no profits. ","['bitcoin', 'E-Toro', 'Facebook', 'Libra']"

At press time, Roubini is fighting with cryptocurrency exchange Bit MEX, which is registered in Seychelles, and says that it, along with several other exchanges, are registered in systematic illegality. Crypto prices are generally volatile. In fact, just two days ago, bitcoin fell below $10,000 and hit the $9,600 mark following a series of negative tweets from President Donald Trump and an ongoing Senate hearing in which former PayPal head and current Libra developer David Marcus was questioned by members of Congress regarding the cryptocurrencys goals and properties. Simon Peters, an analyst at crypto exchange e-Toro, commented on the sudden drops in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies prices, stating: Crypt bears are poised to pounce after several high-profile U.S. government officials took aim at bitcoin and Facebooks Libra this week. The bitcoin pullback, which started over the weekend, is in full force now. Selling pressure has intensified, with prices having now broken below the psychological $10,000 mark. Other cryptos are also falling fast, succumbing to regulatory uncertainty. At press time, however, bitcoin is back up to just over $10,350, though this is still less than where it stood 24 hours ago ($10,600). Roubini has always been of the mind that because they are volatile, cryptocurrencies are scams that are likely to bring about the death of Americas financial system. Earlier this month, Roubini engaged in a war of words with Bit MEX founder Arthur Hayes and even referred to bitcoin as both a cesspool and overhyped. However, his criticism for Bit MEX was directed at the idea that it was somehow responsible for laundering terrorist funds that came from regions like Russia and Islamic states. In a blog post, he wrote: Bit MEX insiders revealed to me that this exchange is used daily for money laundering on a massive scale by terrorists and other criminals from Russia, Iran and elsewhere. The exchange does nothing to stop this, as it profits from these transactions Some of the biggest crypto players may be openly involved in systematic illegality. Bit MEX [is] an unregulated trillion-dollar exchange of crypto derivatives that is domiciled in the Seychelles but active globally It involves peddling to degenerate gamblers (meaning clueless retail investors), crypto derivatives with 100-to-one leverage. Hayes later came to the defense of Bit MEX, exclaiming: Bit MEX provides safe, fast, professional and liquid ways for those who see the potential of crypto and to trade and hedge cryptocurrency risk. We continue to monitor all legal and regulatory developments around the world and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

One of the items to emerge from the shadows that may have contributed to bitcoins fall is Steve Mnuchin, who claimed that bitcoin was headed for strong regulation in the United States. In examining the cryptocurrencys sudden rise over a 24-hour period, one cant help but wonder if Mnuchins words helped the coin rebound somewhat. As we all know, regulation has been a hot topic in the space for several years. Many institutional players have expressed interest in the world of crypto trading but have failed to enter it out of fear that their assets will be stolen or hacked thanks to the ongoing lack of regulation. Mnuchins comments could finally be making many more of these institutional investors come out to join the party. Without fear, they can invest appropriately, which will undoubtedly boost bitcoins price. Recently, the Treasury Secretary issued a statement further explaining the kind of regulatory waves traders within the U.S. can look forward to. He explains: Were going to make sure that bitcoin doesnt become the equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts, which were obviously a risk to the financial system I want to be careful that anybody whos using bitcoin  regardless of what the price is  is using it for proper purposes and not illicit purposes, and there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes. Mnuchin, for the most part, seems open-minded to bitcoins use. When questioned about whether illicit transactions make bitcoin an illegitimate cryptocurrency, he explained: I dont think thats accurate at all. Cash is laundered all the time. We combat bad actors in the U.S. dollar every day to protect the U.S. financial system. In many ways, Mnuchin appears to be comparing bitcoins properties to those of fiat. It seems the tables have turned somewhat for bitcoin in terms of organization-based and corporate attention. For example, many analysts and financial platforms have stated in the past that putting any energy or money into bitcoin was a mistake, and that funding blockchain ventures was the smarter thing to do. However, as of late, funding in blockchain-based businesses has dropped dramatically. Many have turned to bitcoin enterprises given the currencys recent price spikes, which began in April of this year. In addition, large companies are being virtually ignored by hedge fund managers and others who provide financing to new businesses, while startups are presently all the rage. Nicholas Pappageorge, senior analyst at CB Insights, explains of blockchain companies: It took a little bit [of time] for the enthusiasm to wear off.

To be fair, Iran has been secretly involved in bitcoin for a few years. Things began in 2015 at the start of the Iran Nuclear Deal. It was during this period that the nations currency, the rial, fell from about 32,000 for $1 USD to about 120,000 for $1 USD. Thus, many bitcoin miners have since begun the business of extracting new coins and earning a profit by selling or trading these currencies behind closed doors. Why so secretive? Well, because Iran is still very much against any activity that involves cryptocurrency. While the process of bitcoin mining itself is not necessarily banned, the activity of shipping new mining equipment in and out of the country is until Iran can develop newer (and clearer) regulation. Many bitcoin miners live very hidden and refuse to identify themselves out of fear of being persecuted by their countrys government. Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, Irans minister for information and communications technology, explains: It is clear that [Iran] has turned into a heaven for miners. The business of mining is not forbidden in law, but the government and the Central Bank have ordered the Customs Bureau to ban the import of mining machines until new regulations are introduced. For the most part, Jahromi says that Iranians have become more open to cryptocurrencies once the concepts behind them were properly explained. He says: Some of our top clerics have issued fatwas that say bitcoin is money without a reserve; that it is rejected by Islam and cybercurrencies are haram. When we explain to them this is not a currency but an asset, they change their minds. Last year, regulators in Iran began monitoring transactions within the region to ensure that none occurred with foreign currencies. This included bitcoin. It is estimated that over $2 billion in bitcoin transactions occurred within the nations borders, and legislators say this isnt helping the rial get any stronger. In addition, Iran is concerned about the illicit activity that allegedly comes with bitcoin and other digital currencies. Last November, a grand jury in New Jersey accused two Iranian men of hijacking approximately 200 American computer networks for the purpose of extracting bitcoin ransoms. Sigal Mandelker, the Treasurys undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, has suggested that cryptocurrency exchanges and similar crypto-based businesses need to up the ante when it comes to security and keeping customers assets protected. He states: As Iran becomes increasingly isolated and desperate for access to U.S. dollars, it is vital that virtual currency exchanges, peer-to-peer exchangers and other providers of digital currency services harden their networks against these illicit schemes.

While this may not seem like much at first glance, the currency hit a serious curb roughly two days ago when it fell below the $10,000 mark to $9,600 following several ugly blows to its reputation. It is now trading for about $1,000 higher, suggesting that perhaps, while volatility is still prevalent, bitcoin is indeed tougher than it was years ago, as weve been saying for some time. The first nasty hit to bitcoin occurred when U.S. President Donald Trump released several tweets suggesting that cryptocurrencies werent money. He said that he didnt care for digital assets, as their values were based on nothing but thin air. He also commented that many were magnets for money laundering and other illicit activity, such as drug transactions. From there, David Marcus, the head of Facebooks blockchain division, was hit with numerous questions in a Senate hearing regarding the social media conglomerates new cryptocurrency Libra. As it turns out, many Senators and people in Congress werent too crazy about Facebook entering the financial space. Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year, users trust of Facebook has seemingly dropped to all-time lows, and many think the company knows little or nothing when it comes to keeping peoples private information safe and secure. Thus, the idea of Facebook having access to ones monetary data was a little frightening to many in Congress. They ultimately asked the company to hold off on its development plans indefinitely until they could better understand the coins properties and where the company was planning to go with it. Today is the second day of this ongoing Senate grilling. Marcus is still being questioned, and it appears the Libra team is willing to cooperate with congressional requests to keep Libra development to a minimum. Some might consider this a huge blow to cryptocurrency, but this isnt necessarily true. If Libra isnt fully understood, the proper research and attention must be devoted to it prior to its release. Otherwise, many users who are planning to get involved could wind up stuck in the middle of a financial plan that puts their data in needless jeopardy. Second, Facebook still needs to prove to everyone that it knows what its doing. That its learned from the Cambridge Analytica scandal and that it will do everything in its power to ensure peoples financial information doesnt wind up in the wrong hands. In the middle of everything, bitcoin has risen quite a bit, suggesting that the present hits didnt have as big an impact on the currency as we might have thought. In addition, several analysts predicted that Trumps words specifically would careen the currency deeper into mainstream territory. Maybe this is the beginning of their predictions coming true.

President Donald Trump, for example, recently issued a tweetstorm regarding how he doesnt care for bitcoin or other digital coins, saying they arent real money. In addition, several members of Congress are now grilling David Marcus over Facebooks plans regarding the new cryptocurrency Libra, which they claim is dangerous and out of line. Despite all the negative hoopla, there are a few serving in American government that believe specific cryptocurrencies deserve their shot. Among them is Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who recently stated that he likes bitcoin, citing its decentralized nature as a huge benefit for users. He says that all decentralized coins are likely to provide their users with more security, which is exactly why he has such a huge problem with Libra. As it stands, Libra is controlled by several financial conglomerates, including PayPal, Visa and Mastercard. All three companies have contributed finances, time and energy to the project, and thus have a say in what its ideals and goals should be. McCarthy isnt a fan of this setup. He says it provides the companies with ways to ultimately control Libra users and make illicit decisions regarding what can and should be done with their data. He states: When Im on Facebook, Im not the customer. Im the product. Facebook is free because they sell your data to make money. Now, they want to get into business, and theyre not bitcoin Theyre not decentralized I want to see decentralization because Libra concerns me that theyre going to control the market. Despite McCarthys comments and much of Congress attacking Libra at press time, some members of Americas political spectrum dont think Libra deserves all the flack its getting. One of those individuals is Republican Senator Pat Toomey. Hes asking that Congress examine Libra through the appropriate lens and give it a chance. Toomey fears that efforts against Libra could potentially lead to a lack of innovation in Americas financial sector. He comments: I dont want to presume in advance that weve got to prevent the development of upcoming innovation. Maybe there could be some innovation in this space that would provide security and that would dramatically lower the cost of transactions. Toomey isnt about just opening the door to Facebook, however. He does have a few questions for the company, such as what its real motivation is. He says the company has never expressed interest in the financial market before, and he wonders why its now so eager to revamp itself as a banking platform: It sounds like theyre suggesting its not about getting data. If thats not the real motivator here, what is? Thats a real question for me. ","['bitcoin', 'Kevin McCarthy', 'Libra', 'Pat Toomey']"

After all, every digital assets price is something of a gamble, and through the efforts of Ledger X, you can now bet on the chances of bitcoin reaching $100,000 by the end of 2020. To say this has been a rough week for bitcoin would be something of an understatement. The currency has lost roughly one quarter of its overall value following scrutiny from President Donald Trump, who announced in a recent series of tweets that he wasnt a fan of bitcoin or cryptocurrencies as they werent real money and their values were based on thin air. In addition, Facebooks new Libra cryptocurrency is now being questioned by members of Congress given the social media companys less-than-stellar reputation following the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Despite all this, many analysts predict that the coverage is good for bitcoin and will potentially launch it deeper into mainstream territory. Tom Lee of Fundstrat fame, for example, recently predicted that bitcoin could shoot as high as $40,000 by the end of the year thanks to Presidents Trump further exposure of the coin. Some are so confident that bitcoin will reach new heights within the next year-and-a-half that Ledger X, a new U.S.-regulated derivatives exchange, is allowing its customers to bet on the currencys price between now and December of 2020. Users can bet for or against the idea that the currency will reach a $100,000 price by that time. Those who guess correctly will divide the final pot amongst themselves. If bitcoin does reach $100,000 within the allotted time, the currencys market cap would be at an even $2 trillion and stand as one of the most prominent assets available to investors. At press time, it is one of the few derivatives being offered to players in the retail market, though many institutional investors  with assets between $10 million and $1 billion  have also shown interest in the project. In a recent interview, chief executive officer of Ledger X Paul Chou explained: Often what happens is the first trade is the most important, and everybody else watches it Dozens and dozens of these institutions got back to us saying wed be interested in trading a contract like this. I understand $100,000 is a large number, but a lot of us whove been in this space remember bitcoin at one dollar, then it hit ten dollars, and $100 and then $10,000. A $100,000 contract doesnt even make us blink. Institutional players are emerging in droves to play in the crypto space. Recently, derivatives exchanges like CME Group and Bit MEX claimed that institutional players were driving trading volumes to records. In addition, organizations like the Intercontinental Exchange are planning to begin their testing processes of bitcoin beginning on July 22. ","['bitcoin', 'Donald Trump', 'Ledger X']"

This is the second time this month the currency has hit such a low level. In addition, the currency has fallen by roughly $1,200 since late last night when it was trading for just shy of $10,900. In all, bitcoin has fallen by approximately $4,000 since its high point of $13,600 in mid-June. We keep going back and forth regarding bitcoins volatility, and the truth is, its as noticeable as ever. These last two weeks have been particularly hard on the currencys overall stamina, with President Trump first emerging from the shadows to declare that he wasnt a fan of crypto and that it wasnt real money. From there, Libra was grilled by Senate members who all stated the same thing: that they dont trust Facebook and that its going to be a while before anyone feels comfortable enough to give the company their financial data. Bitcoin has taken a very bearish turn as of late, and while analysts claim that the currency will ultimately rebound from all this, enthusiasts and traders everywhere are feeling the burn. Tom Lee, a senior analyst at Fundstrat, says that Libra is consistently being paired up with bitcoin, which isnt entirely fair to the latter. The two currencies have nothing to do with one another. They are both entirely different when it comes to their properties and ideals, considering Libra is a stable currency, and both have entirely different functions. He states: In a world without Libra, is crypto going to be successful? Absolutely, so I dont think it changes the long-term outlook for bitcoin. Lee further states that Trumps recent Twitter tirade against crypto will ultimately bring bitcoin to the $40,000 mark by the end of the year. While Trumps words were largely negative, bitcoin will ultimately be brought closer to mainstream status through his words, and people are the world will take notice. He suggests: On balance, its a positive because cryptocurrencies and bitcoin really are in the main stage, now. Congress, the Fed, the president weighing in. Its going to force everybody who is not involved and remember a very small percentage cares about crypto and bitcoin. Its going to force the other 98 percent of the world to think about what it means Bitcoin is now trading at a level that its only seen three percent of its historical days. If you go back to every milestone that that was achieved, bitcoin subsequently rallied somewhere between 200 percent to 400 percent within the next four months, so I think if thats playing out this time, that means bitcoin could be $20,000 to $40,000 sometime in the fourth quarter.

It seems residents of the U.S. have more regulation to look forward to. During the conference, Mnuchin explained that the country is taking a strict stance on digital currencies and claims that it will subject many of the nations leading crypto exchanges and trading platforms to the same banking regulations that most traditional financial establishments face. Mnuchin, along with most of Trumps administration, is fearful that cryptocurrency can be used for illicit purposes, such as money laundering. This conference comes following President Trumps tweets over the weekend saying that he did not care for bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. In his tweets, Trump claimed that digital assets were not real money and that their prices were based on thin air rather than legit financial trends and usage. The situation boasts several sides, some positive and some negative. On the one hand, the U.S. has been lagging when it comes to implementing the appropriate legislation to make crypto trading far more legitimate. Whether die-hard fans of crypto wish to acknowledge this or not, digital currencies are still vulnerable to hackings, volatility and other problems that make them less-than-stellar investments in the eyes of institutional players. Incorporating stricter rules for cryptocurrency exchanges and related platforms to follow could finally convince these investors to enter the space, bringing crypto to an even higher position, and who wouldnt want that? At the same time, one must wonder, exactly, what stricter regulation can really do. Japan, for example, employs some of the strictest crypto regulation in the world, yet it still seems just as vulnerable to illicit activity as ever. Recently, one of the countrys most popular exchanges, Bit Point, was victimized by hackers that ultimately stole more than $30 million-worth of users cryptocurrency funds. The coins were stored in hot wallets that ultimately made them more vulnerable to thieves and malicious actors. Prior to this event, Japan had begun utilizing the aid of the countrys Financial Services Agency (FSA) to monitor all cryptocurrency exchange activity and ensure it remained up-to-speed regarding stricter regulatory tactics. Following the Coincheck hack in 2018, the FSA began sending threatening letters to exchanges that didnt meet expectations, explaining that the time had come to shape up or ship out. Ironically, Bit Point is an exchange that received one of these letters, which clearly didnt make enough of an impact on the companys operations. In addition, regions of the U.S., such as New York, have attempted to implement stricter regulation through the BitLicense. The maneuver simply caused several companies to exit the Big Apple and seek business elsewhere. ","['crypto-regulation', 'Donald Trump', 'Steven Mnuchin']"

While they do happen, they are relatively rare when compared to the illicit behavior that occurs through digital means. In recent news, one of those physical attacks have taken place. A criminal gang in India sought to kidnap three cryptocurrency traders and hold them against their will in exchange for a bitcoin ransom. All were tortured while the gang demanded a whopping 80 units of BTC. The three men were held against their will for a total of 15 days. Seven members of the gang were arrested following a raid on their holding quarters after 13 hours of police negotiations which came to a standstill. The victims are now being identified as Luftan Shaikh, age 19; Mohammad Shazad, age 36, and Malang Shah, age 44. They were rescued from a high-rise building after having been beaten for several days. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Vikas Sharma explained in a statement: The gang kidnapped Shaikh and Shazad, two bitcoin traders, and demanded 80 bitcoins Shah was kidnapped two days later. The gang demanded [money] from his family members. Most of the time, cryptocurrency attacks occur through digital means, either via hackings or cyberattacks in which thieves steal funds through crypto exchanges. This recently occurred with a Japanese trading platform known as Bit Point. In all, approximately $32 million worth of crypto funds disappeared and made their way into the hackers hands. In addition, theft can also occur through SIM-swapping, in which hackers bribe employees of a users cell phone provider to garner their private data and account information. If the user happens to own crypto, the hacker can sneak into their account unnoticed and coordinate their attack from there. Cryptocurrency has also been at the center of several ransomware cases or malware, the most common being crypto-jacking software that allows a hacker to take control of a users computer or digital device without their permission. They can mine cryptocurrencies for a profit from the persons computer, who all the while earns nothing from the process other than high energy bills. Following the raid, the kidnappers took flight and engaged authorities in a 20-minute chase that saw them arrested in a suburban area of Jaipur. The culprits had lured the traders to their hideout by alleging sales of low-priced bitcoin units. India-based media platform NDTV is quoted as explaining: [The gang] wanted to extort money from the trio.

Bitcoin has been around for more than ten years. The initial whitepaper discussing bitcoin emerged in 2008, during the final year of President George W. Bushs second term. This means that three sitting U.S. presidents have had the opportunity to address cryptocurrencies, which have long gone ignored until now. Donald Trump is the first U.S. president to acknowledge crypto and its existence, and while the comments he made may have been negative in the long run, many argue that the mere mention of bitcoin by a U.S. leader is enough to catapult it into a highly competitive state. Jeremy Allaire is the chief executive of Circle, a bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange and payments group. He recently took to Twitter to suggest that bitcoin was about to hit a whole new benchmark thanks, in part, to Donald Trump. He states: Possibly the largest bull signal for [bitcoin] ever. Crypto is now a presidential/ global policy issue. People everywhere will embrace a mix of sovereign and non-sovereign digital currency. This seems to be the primary reaction amongst most individuals who see the news as positive, rather than unruly. They suggest that whether he meant to or not, Trump has ultimately made cryptocurrency a global policy issue that will no doubt take precedence in the upcoming 2020 election, and that digital assets are about to solidify their legitimacy like they never have before. Chief executive of U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase Brian Armstrong commented: Achievement unlocked! I dreamt about a sitting U.S president needing to respond to growing cryptocurrency usage years ago. First, they ignore you. Then, they laugh at you. Then, they fight you. Then, you win. We just made it to step three, yall. The idea of Trump bashing bitcoin is hardly the point. Many advocates say that his mere mention of it is likely to bring a whole new level of awareness to bitcoin and digital assets. The mainstream public is likely to take greater interest and potentially invest further, bringing the space to new heights. Mati Greenspan, senior analyst at e-Toro, states: Even though Donald says hes not a fan of bitcoin, the fact that hes mentioning it at all is hugely bullish for the entire crypto market. Some presidential candidates going against Trump in 2020 have built their reputations on crypto. Among them is democratic candidate Andrew Yang, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur. Yang recently commented on the strength of blockchain technology, stating: The blockchain has a wealth of potential. [It] could make many things more secure, transparent and efficient.

Several crypto investors and analysts working within the space have taken to social media to blast the President and his alleged lack of knowledge on crypto. Three days ago, President Trump tweeted: I am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity. Among the people to fight back were Tyler Winklevoss, one of the founders of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange in New York. In response to the Presidents message, Tyler explains: We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error. Journalist Emily Parker, wrote that up until this point, bitcoin had been relatively unaffected by Trump, but shes worried this may soon change. Her message states: Trump just tweeted about bitcoin for the first time Until now, bitcoin has been relatively immune to the Trump news cycle Well see if that changes. Coin Centers Neeraj K. Agrawal comments that a society without cryptocurrency and bitcoin becomes a surveillance society, while finance writer David Gokhshtein stated confidently that bitcoin is likely to replace gold in the coming years. While its hard to say for sure what will happen following the Twitter rampage, its hard to dismiss the idea that President Trump might have made a mistake with his recent comments. For one thing, there is a very large community of individuals that have invested their time, money and efforts into cryptocurrencies. This community is likely made up of both Democrats and Republicans, and its possible Trump is angering people within his own party. Second, if what Preston Byrne suggests is correct and Trump is only writing these tweets based on suggestions from his advisors, this could be an even bigger mistake. One could take this as a lack of personal judgement. Rather, its simply parroting what one is told, which up to this point, seemed to go against Trumps personality and leadership. Donald Trump has always been outspoken and unafraid to speak his mind, so if these are indeed the words of his advisors and not of himself, hes likely to take some flack and look more like a politician to audiences. In the long run, however, we must remember that Trumps words are based on opinion rather than fact, and that over the past few months, bitcoin has exhibited a newfound maturity that has allowed it to withstand several blows. Thus, we cannot assume that the end of bitcoin is near following the tweets. ","['bitcoin', 'Donald Trump', 'Twitter']"

At press time, the currency is trading for just over $10,400. This is about $1,000 less than where it stood 24 hours ago. Its very disappointing to see volatility strike everybodys favorite cryptocurrency in this way. After all, bitcoin has been managing to maintain its position of over $11,000, but with the President and entrepreneurs like Mark Cuban labeling crypto as something we should all be wary of, the pressure has likely become far too much to handle. In a recent Twitter storm, the President labeled currencies like Libra as untrustworthy, saying that it holds no merit and that it doesnt stand on a sturdy platform. He also commented that he does not care for cryptocurrencies, saying that they often attract illicit activity and that they are not real money. Cryptocurrency lawyer Preston Byrne, in an interview, suggested that Trump wrote those tweets not necessarily because he wanted to, but because his advisors told him to. Byrne states that the U.S. government, as of late, is run by several boomers and older gentlemen who dont really understand what bitcoin and crypto is. Thus, theyre not likely to realize what it can do and what it can be used for. Either way, the comments have taken their toll on crypto, bitcoin especially, which has fallen greatly within a single day. Its unclear how the currency will react in the coming days. Will it remain as is for some time? Are the drops coming to an end, or are we likely to see more before things turn around? One things for sure: volatility is still very much an issue, even more so than this publication has suggested in recent days. While bitcoin has undergone a new wave of maturity  reports have been published on this subject  bitcoin is still vulnerable to price swings and similar problems, and it can occur without notice. Over the past two days, bitcoin has maintained its $11,000+ position despite the comments made. Nobody really expected it to fall as suddenly or as drastically as it did, but fallen it has, and the currency has hit its lowest point since late June. One bit of news we can be excited about: bitcoin is still more than double what it was in early April. During that period, the currency rose to new heights and hit the $5,000 mark for the first time in several months, and for the most part, it has been on a role ever since. Granted it has kept some of its overall strength, perhaps we can see small, yet additional price spikes in the coming days to make up for its latest activity.

At press time, bitcoin is trading for approximately $11,400. This is about $200 less than where it stood yesterday. Even though a small drop has occurred, enthusiasts should be examining bitcoin in a whole new light. Yesterday was marred by harsh news regarding crypto. First came the comments by Donald Trump. The second negative news came in the form of Bit Point, a cryptocurrency exchange stationed in Japan. The company is the latest victim of a hack that saw more than $30 million of users funds disappear overnight. These hacks dont seem to stop. Regardless of strong regulation, particularly in Japan, attackers always seem to edge past security to get their fingers on money that isnt theirs. In addition, it doesnt help much to have the president of the worlds most powerful nation saying that hes not a fan of cryptocurrency. Yesterday could have turned out much worse than it did, and yet bitcoin has only dropped by about $200. This is quite amazing when one really considers the issues at hand. Two or three years ago, theres no doubt bitcoin would have likely fallen by more than $1,000 just from the comments alone. Add the hacking to the mix, and theres no telling how much could have been lost. Yet bitcoin is maintaining its present position, for the most part. The currency has clearly shot up not only in price this year, but in overall maturity. This could not have occurred previously, but the currency appears to be stronger than ever. This may be the proof that analysts need showing bitcoin is surging thanks to legitimate market trends rather than speculation. In his Twitter rampage against crypto, Donald Trump was particularly harsh towards Libra, the cryptocurrency being developed by Facebook. He commented that the currency stood on very little ground, and would be subject to the strictest banking regulations imaginable: Facebooks Libra virtual currency will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new banking carter and become subject to all banking regulations just like other banks. Of course, Trump isnt the only world leader to express such skepticism when it comes to Libra and crypto. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has commented that while regulators must have an open mind when it comes to Libra, they must not grant it any special leeway. In addition, the United Kingdom has announced that it is considering a ban on all crypto products given how volatile they are. Trump also attacked digital assets volatility in his recent tweets.

Trump Crypto Comments Lead to Mad Gab,"['Trump Rubs Some People the Wrong Way', 'Is Volatility Still That Big an Issue?']"," Uh-oh. It looks like President Donald Trump has angered a few people following his recent statements regarding cryptocurrency. On Twitter, the President suggested that all crypto assets were not money, and that the U.S.s only true currency was USD. Trump was particularly cold towards both bitcoin and Libra  the cryptocurrency being developed by Facebook. In the tweet, Trump attacked the volatility often associated with these currencies. This didnt fly with a social media platform called Gab, which is particularly popular amongst right-wing and conservative users. The company messaged the President and criticized his opinion of crypto, claiming: You are wrong about this. Bitcoin is free speech money. In addition, the company appeared to suggest that Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was somehow behind the message or responsible for it. It followed up with: Jared, give the phone back to Donald. Gab has been at the center of controversy in the past. It was discovered that the Pittsburg synagogue shooter last year responsible for the murders of roughly 11 people and the injuring of six others had posted anti-Semitic content on the site many times. Gab was temporarily closed after it lost its connection to GoDaddy, its web hosting partner. GoDaddy criticized Gab for failing to halt hate speech on its platform. Gab was also left out of Trumps recent social media summit which was hosted at the White House. Gab didnt take kindly to this maneuver, commenting that Trump merely filled his summit with safe z-list MAGA celebrities and cheerleaders.  Cryptocurrencies, particularly Libra, have come under fire by several world leaders. The United Kingdom is now considering a permanent ban on all crypto-related products given the volatility they exhibit, while other nations, such as India, will not allow Libra-based services within its borders. In addition, several U.S. lawmakers have asked Facebook to hold off on its Libra plans indefinitely until they can better understand what the company is seeking to accomplish through a crypto platform. For the most part, volatility is getting to be a very old argument when it comes to criticizing cryptocurrencies. While volatility is still a problem, the issue seems to have calmed down somewhat in recent months. What were witnessing at press time, for example  bitcoin has recently fallen from $12,500 to about $11,600  is more a standard correction than a full-on price swing. In fact, currencies like bitcoin have been expanding heavily in price over the past few months. Falling to roughly $3,500 in November of last year, bitcoin struck a new low with many traders and stayed within this range for approximately five months until April 2019, when it hit $5,000 for the first time in a long while. The currency has been on a bullish run ever since. ","['bitcoin', 'Gab', 'Libra', 'Trump']"

Libra is the new cryptocurrency being released by social media platform Facebook. The asset is not due to make its official debut until 2020, but already it appears to be stirring loads of controversy, with members of Congress requesting that Facebook postpone its plans indefinitely so that they can better understand its properties, goals and ideals. This may take some time, which is why David Marcus  head of blockchain at Facebook and the primary designer of Libra  is trying desperately to assure Congress that the coin is being developed in an ethical and proper way. Unfortunately, his words seem to be falling on deaf ears, and nobody is convinced that Libra is worthy of high standing. Among those who see Libra as a problem is entrepreneur Mark Cuban of Shark Tank fame. In a recent interview with CNBC, Cuban commented: Im not a big fan of what theyre doing there. I think its a big mistake Globally and in countries where there isnt a lot of rule of law, or a lot of government stability or currency stability, then it could be dangerous. Theres going to be some despot in some African country that gets really upset that they cant control their currency anymore and thats where the real problems start occurring. The biggest tirade came from U.S. President Donald Trump, who took to Twitter to bash not only Libra, but bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. In a statement to his followers, Trump states: I am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity Similarly, Facebooks Libra virtual currency will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new banking charter and become subject to banking regulations, just like other banks, both national and international We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the world, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States dollar! Its true that cryptocurrencies can fall victim to price swings and volatility. Bitcoin, for example, struck a new low in late 2018 when it fell to the mid-$3,000 range after trading at nearly $20,000 in December of 2017. At press time, however, bitcoin has been on a steady rise for approximately three months. Reaching $5,000 in April 2019, the currency has been spiking ever since and is currently trading for $11,600.

Why do they assume that every digital asset is created equal? This isnt Animal Farm, people. All forms of crypto bring different aspects to the table, and some, like bitcoin, are clearly more capable than others. Its annoying to see so many individuals pair certain cryptocurrencies together, especially when some have no place being in the same categories. For example, bitcoin is presently sliding at press time thanks, in part, to the Fed chair claiming that Facebooks Libra raises serious concerns. Yesterday, bitcoin was trading for about $12,400. Well, this little comment has caused the granddaddy of crypto to lose roughly $800 overnight. Its now trading for $11,600. First off, why this is occurring with bitcoin is somewhat of a mystery. The currency, which has developed a rather thick skin as of late, shouldnt be suffering this much because of one silly, stupid comment. How can it drop this much over just a few words of dialogue, yet it can spike several thousand dollars after Binance loses nearly $40 million in bitcoin units?! Bitcoin is still being haunted by volatility, but that volatility is harder than ever to understand or explain. Second, Libra, will all respect, doesnt even deserve to be placed in the same category as bitcoin. Libra has still yet to enter the official crypto market. Right now, the company (Facebook) is engaged in developing the currency from scratch. Its set for release in 2020 and its already raising huge levels of controversy before its even out and available for use. It has no track record and is coming from an enterprise that has been marred with scandal following questionable practices regarding users private data. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been around for roughly ten years. Its an established cryptocurrency thats being utilized by several nations and reached its all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. By contrast, Libra is slated to be a stable currency tied to USD, meaning that while it will be less vulnerable to price swings, its likely to remain the same granted inflation never becomes a harsh reality in America. Nevertheless, bitcoin has fallen over the last 24 hours thanks largely to the comments made by Jerome H. Powell, who serves as a chair of the same financial committee headed by Rep. Maxine Waters in Congress. As we all know, Waters has been very critical of Facebooks Libra in the past, requesting that the company put their plans on hold indefinitely until Congress can understand more. Shes currently in a head-to-head battle with David Marcus, the leader of Facebooks blockchain division, and has commented that the U.S. is seriously behind when it comes to implementing crypto regulation. Waters and Powell are clearly a deadly barricade when for crypto innovation. ","['bitcoin', 'Facebook', 'Libra']"

This is about $700 higher than where it stood yesterday, suggesting the currency is already back on track to reaching new heights this year. Bitcoin has been on a steady rise since April of 2019 when it hit $5,000. Yesterday, Live Bitcoin News published an article that suggested many sources and charts believed the currency would continue to rise over the next five to six months at the minimum. So far, those predictions seem to be coming true, as all bitcoin needs to do is rise another $1,000 before it once again strikes the highest mark its set this year. While this is certainly good news, it cannot be denied that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin still suffer from volatility. After all, the currency dropped by roughly $3,000 about two weeks ago and required a bit of time to get back to where it was. This can be said for most cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, for example, is trading in the high $200 range, whereas before it was in the mid-$300s. So, while 2019 is potentially proving to be the year for crypto, price swings are still a little more common than wed like. However, some sources claim that this isnt necessarily a bad thing  that there are positive sides to volatility that investors can potentially gain from. One is that volatility consistently leaves the door open to further price boosts. This is the trouble with fiat and stable coins, which tend to remain constant. Theres no chance of potential gains given that they are locked in with currencies that serve as traditional forms of national money. The U.S. dollar, the yen, the euro and other forms of fiat are not immune to problems. The U.S. dollar has had trouble with inflation in the past, while other entities like the bolivar, the national currency of Venezuela, has virtually lost all its value thanks to ongoing inflation, but for the most part, fiat is designed to remain steady in times of trouble. Crypto, on the other hand, is being utilized more for speculative purposes. It is being looked at more as an investment tool; a way to build ones wealth and net worth. Thus, volatility can serve a strange purpose in these situations. Volatility keeps these currencies speculative, meaning people can continue to invest in them and potentially gain greater wealth down the line. Unfortunately, many regulators and skeptics alike view volatility as a strictly negative aspect, and label cryptocurrencies as unfit investments or unsuitable for retail players. Yes, its true that crypto does stand to lose everything, but granted it moves in the opposite direction, those involved can earn more than they ever thought possible.

This is about $400 to $600 higher than where its been throughout most of last week. Bitcoin has been on a roll since April of this year, when it first struck the $5,000 mark. However, it has been trapped in a strange state over the past two weeks and has struggled with key resistance points in the $10,000 and $11,000 ranges. While its come close to the $12,000 range a few times over the past several days, it has never quite moved past this mark and has struggled in the long run. At the same time, many individuals see bitcoin as a much stronger asset; a coin that can sustain negative market trends and retain a thick skin. Among those people is Mark Mobius, a markets fund manager and the founder of Mobius Capital Partners. In a new interview, Mobius explains that while hes never seen bitcoin as a solid store of value, hell have no choice but to invest in it if it continues to grow the way it has been these past three months. He explains: Im not a buyer, but I realize that it is something we must account for. The reason why Im not a buyer is that I dont know what the real value is and unless it is so widely held and accepted, then thats a different story. Lets face it: all currencies are based on faith. If you have faith in the dollar or faith in the renminbi or faith in the euro, whatever it is, then you can use it. It looks like Mobius needs to get that checkbook out and start making some crypto purchases here and there as according to new charts and market trends, bitcoins bullish behavior is just getting started. One source says that bitcoin is likely to continue its meteoric rise over the next several months, and experts suggest that many corporations now see a value in bitcoin they never believed possible. Edward Moya, chief market strategist at Oanda Corporation in New York, comments: Bitcoin looks like it could be coiling for a big breakout as institutional interest for blockchain technology shows no signs of slowing down. The bubble-like gains this time are driven on solid institutional interest and while security is still a big risk, it appears bitcoin has overcome many of its initial growing pains. Christel Quek, chief commercial officer at Bold Global, echoed this sentiment, and says that many organizations, traders and institutions that once turned their backs on crypto are suddenly showing newfound respect for bitcoin and its cousins. He states: The revival has been a natural reaction to changing crypto-friendly atmospheres in mainstream finance and pro-market forces. The support from mainstream entities will propel digital tokens forward. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Mark Mobius']"

Users will now be able to monitor the goings-on of their favorite digital assets, including bitcoin, bitcoin cash and Ethereum, and see how theyre doing in terms of prices and news trends. At press time, the application is only available for mobile devices. Those who have Sina Finance on their computers or laptops wont be able to access the cryptocurrency index, but its still a step in the right direction. The Global Times has stated publicly that cryptocurrency is necessary if China is to thrive, explaining: If China cannot participate in this new phase of the digital economic revolution, then it may find itself in a passive position within currency competition, not to mention it could lose its advantages within the internet and financial technology sectors. China has had a very odd relationship with cryptocurrencies. For the most part, the country has profited greatly from mining and similar crypto-related activity, though recently, the nation took heavy action against all cryptocurrency mining, exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs), banning the latter two and threatening to do so with the former, though a stance against bitcoin and related crypto mining has yet to become a reality. Its unclear if the country is just throwing out empty threats when it comes to mining, or, for lack of better terms, its just being lazy. For many years, bitcoin mining has been on a list in China of potentially hazardous activities that pose threats to the Earths atmosphere. It has long been stated that bitcoin mining will be banned in the coming future as a means of protecting the planet, though at press time, this has yet to occur, and the Chinese government doesnt seem to be pushing the ban any further. However, individuals have little to no access to cryptocurrency exchanges or digital wallets, and ICOs have generally become a thing of the past, though this certainly has its positives. ICOs were once considered a solid and popular means of garnering capital and funds for a new startup, though as of late, they have seemingly dropped off the financial map, as several have tuned out to be phony or fraudulent. Several companies use ICOs to gather the funds they need to complete or begin their operations. Investors give their money in exchange for a new coin that they can use to access the companys goods and services. The problem is that many of these companies disappear halfway down the line. The money they received either wasnt enough to move forward, or they were fraudulent from the beginning and sought only to steal money. The companies walk away with their funds, while investors are left with empty wallets and bruised egos. ","['china', 'cryptocurrency', 'Sina Finance']"

This is both shocking and easy to believe at the same time. On the one hand, its a little surprising that most tweets surrounding these currencies arent coming from countries like Japan or South Korea. At one time, South Korea accounted for roughly one-quarter of the worlds cryptocurrency transactions, and while the nation has taken steps to ban initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other maneuvers that can be considered hazardous to both crypto and its investors, the country still holds a powerful position in the crypto and blockchain spaces. Japan is also very high when it comes to regulation, and hosts what appears to be an endless array of crypto-based exchanges and startups. In addition, what about Switzerland? Why are there not more messages coming from this region? The country, after all, is home to Crypto Valley  a region in the village of Zug that plays host to more crypto and blockchain-based startups and businesses than anywhere else in the world. There are also areas like Malta, which now serve as the headquarters to many cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, that once made their homes in Asia, specifically China, and ran to escape the allegedly innovation-crushing regulation there that has since reared its ugly head. Then again, the United States and the United Kingdom seem to be making the biggest stands either against or for these and other forms of cryptocurrencies as of late. When it comes to Libra, for example, many members of the U.S. Congress have requested that Facebook place an indefinite hold on its plans to develop Libra so that all the questions surrounding its properties and prospects can be answered. Congress wants to ensure that Facebooks heart is in the right place when it comes to Libra. The company has been weighed down by several scandals over the past few years, especially the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw Facebook reportedly selling users private data to third parties for advertising purposes. Head executive Mark Zuckerberg was grilled on national television by several members of Congress for not taking a stronger stance against users privacy being invaded. The U.K. has also announced plans to potentially ban all crypto-related investment products from here on out, calling cryptocurrency an unsuitable investment when compared to traditional options like stocks and bonds. The U.K. is largely worried about the volatility and the price swings that come with digital assets like bitcoin and are concerned that too many investors stand to lose all their money. Thus, the FCA has announced that its now looking to implement the ban for the protection of future traders. ","['bitcoin', 'Libra', 'U.K.', 'U.S.']"

James and Martin started Brew Dog to be an alternative to the status quo: to challenge perceptions and revolutionize their industry. The developers, miners and users of cryptocurrency, are the same. Joining forces to link the old and new financial systems is a perfect fit. Simply head to our website and once you submit your application youll be given the option to invest in Brew Dog using crypto. Those who take part in the opportunity early will have the chance to purchase as little as 25 pounds-worth of shares. In addition, all who take advantage now will receive six full cans of Cryptonite West Coast IPA, the companys most popular concoction. Among the additional benefits that users will receive if they become official equity punks are free beer on their birthdays, discounts when booking large parties, invites to the openings of all future Brew Dog bars, and a whole lot more. Though based in Scotland, Brew Dog has been making a name for itself all over the world as of late. In fact, one cryptocurrency meetup in Brazil scheduled their events at a Brew Dog bar. In addition, the company announced last year that its brewery in London would allow customers to pay for beer using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As exciting as it all sounds, Brew Dog is being rather up front with all its investors, saying that shares can potentially go up or down in the coming weeks. This is no different than any other investing opportunity; theres no way to predict where shares will go, and there are risks that potential investors will need to think about. The announcement also explains: The people who have invested in us and become Equity Punks have shown what can be achieved with taking charge of something you believe in. We are proud to be extending Equity for Punks so that more of you can join our community, and in adopting cryptocurrency payments to do so. ","['Brew Dog', 'Brewery', 'cryptocurrency']"

After so much alleged appeal to young people and the growing hype surrounding cryptocurrencies, it appears members of generation Z are unlikely to spend their time or money on digital assets. According to a new survey conducted by Business Insider, young people between the ages of 13 and 21 are largely bearish when it comes to cryptocurrency. Roughly 52 percent of those involved in the survey  just over half  say that they will never purchase, trade or invest in digital assets, while only 26 percent  just over one-quarter of those involved  stated that they were considering it. In total, approximately 1,884 people were surveyed. Whats particularly disappointing is that young people arguably stand to gain the most from crypto and its respective technology. For one thing, digitization is largely part of their generation. Between smart phones, portable computers, notepads, iPads and everything else they seem to carry with them, the idea of having everything digitized and readily available is something thats tied largely to their age groups. If computers, phones and the respective data they carry can all be digitized, why not cash? In addition, it would appear at this stage that cryptocurrency has become the inevitable next step in the development and evolution of money. Cash, for example, is now being used less than credit cards, and it would seem like crypto can potentially take over completely once credit and debit cards wear out their welcomes. The monetary space has incurred several changes over just the last 30 years alone, and cryptocurrency has given us many signs that its here to stay. Young people should be investigating crypto as much as they can, as its likely to be the norm when theyre in their 30s and 40s. Now would be a good time to understand the technology and get a head start on how its utilized. Nevertheless, it appears younger generations are still largely deterred by the behavior bitcoin and its crypto-cousins exhibited in 2018. As we all remember, bitcoin reached its all-time high of nearly $20,000 during the previous December. Starting in early 2018, all cryptocurrencies  bitcoin in particular  began experiencing solid price drops that caused many to lose as much as 70, 80 or even 90 percent of their values. The survey suggests that many younger individuals are concerned that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will repeat this behavior in the coming months or years, and they fear losing in the long run. The survey appears to leave some room open for hope in that Facebook is now producing Libra  a new cryptocurrency  and bitcoin and several altcoins have been making a comeback over the past three months. Perhaps these and other new developments can get younger traders interested in digital assets. ","['bitcoin', 'generation Z', 'young people']"

This is about $1,500 higher than the currencys low point last week when it was selling for approximately $10,400. For the most part, bitcoin has exhibited new strength that many enthusiasts arent used to seeing. For one thing, the currency clearly underwent a short correction phase. The asset dropped, but it didnt drop for long, and it didnt need that much time or space to start building its price back up. There have been a few small slumps here and there, but bitcoin has largely been on the rise since April when it first reached $5,000  a price many traders thought was out of reach given bitcoins previous 15-month run in the gutter. But analysts are also warning enthusiasts not to get too comfortable. New research suggests that holidays tend to boost crypto conversations and interest. People bring it up at the dinner table, and as a result, they become intrigued enough to start trading or adding to their portfolios. In all, this is good news. It helps to legitimize the space further and bolsters users education and knowledge of the crypto industry. At the same time, research also shows that these little tidbits dont tend to give cryptocurrencies their due. Digital assets may experience price hikes during these holiday periods, but the hikes dont last long. This time around, the holiday in question is the U.S. Independence Day taking place on July 4, and while bitcoin may be doing well at press time, analysts are worried that things could fall back a bit in the coming days once the holiday has ceased. In a blog post, researchers at SFOX explain: Part of the narrative surrounding [the 2017] unprecedented bull run was that many people were hearing about bitcoin for the first time. Over Thanksgiving dinner, the story goes, Luddites in the family would ask the more tech-savvy among them about this bitcoin theyd seen in mainstream news  and how could they purchase some bitcoin coins for themselves? They continue to say: Holidays within the bounds of pronounced bitcoin bull runs may correlate with temporary upswings in price, potentially due to FOMO [fear of missing out]. As the current bull run continues and major holidays take place, traders may do well to consider how much of market movements is from changed fundamentals and how much is from mass psychology. While improved fundamentals pave the way for sustained growth, the whims of psychology, historically, have proven to be relatively short-lived. What would be fantastic is if bitcoin proves to the world just how strong and stable its become and manages to either retain its current place after July 4 or grow even further in price.

The asset is now trading for about $1,500 more than where it stood just a week ago, suggesting that the currency is not only enduring a correctional phase, but bursting with strength given how little time it has needed before jumping the gun and adding more to its price yet again. Bitcoin has certainly developed a thicker hide over the past year. Unfortunately, reports are still emerging that the currency utilizes too much energy. In a recent analysis, it is being suggested that bitcoin uses more energy through mining operations than the entire nation of Switzerland. This is even more ironic when one considers the country in question. Switzerland is home to a region called Zug, which houses what has been playfully labeled Crypto Valley. Taking its name from Silicon Valley in Northern California, an area known for its growing list of tech hubs and startups, Crypto Valley headquarters several European blockchain and cryptocurrency-related enterprises. The report suggests that all these businesses combined do not use the amount of energy utilized by the worlds many bitcoin mining rigs. The data stems from a new index that was launched earlier this week known as the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI). The platform estimates how much energy is required to maintain bitcoin operations in real time. It then calculates an annual sum. Thus far, it appears bitcoin is using more than seven giga-watts of electricity, which over a span of 12 months, comes out to around 64 terawatt hours. Switzerland, by comparison, uses around 58 terawatts, though bitcoin still isnt using quite as much energy as Latin American countries such as Colombia, which utilizes 68 terawatt hours. CBECI co-creator Michel Rauchs explains in an interview: We want to use comparisons that set the narrative. Visitors of the website can make up their own minds as to whether it seems large or small. It was recently reported that bitcoin mining utilizes as much energy as the city of Las Vegas. Given the number of lights, casino operations and slot machines one can find in Vegas  many of which operate all night  thats clearly a lot of electricity. At the same time, the indexs parent company  the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance  acknowledges that the platforms findings arent 100 percent accurate. It also states that several indexes exist for measuring bitcoins energy consumption, and most seem to produce different results. In a blog post, the company mentions: Reliable estimates of bitcoins electricity usage are rare. In most cases, they only provide a one-time snapshot and the numbers often show substantial discrepancies from one model to another. ","['bitcoin', 'Energy Consumption', 'switzerland']"

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. has released a statement saying that it is considering a ban on all cryptocurrency-related products, as they are too volatile and therefore unfit for small-time investors. This is an argument that weve been hearing for some time, and one well likely continue to hear until assets like bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin fully stabilize. What can be said about cryptos volatility is that it has calmed down somewhat in 2019. Bitcoin, for example, after trading at relatively low prices throughout all of 2018 and the first quarter of this year, has suddenly burst in price and began trading in the $5,000 range last April. From there, it incurred several additional spikes that saw it rise to approximately $6,000, then $7,000, then $8,000. At press time, it is trading for over $11,000 and more than doubled its price over the last three months. And yet, despite this good news, bitcoin is still being hit from all angles by volatility. Just last week, the currency was trading for roughly $13,600. Thus, the price has fallen by roughly $2,000 in just a matter of days. For the most part, this behavior appears to be a simple (and relatively normal) correction, but price swings still seem to be part of the crypto atmosphere. Christopher Woolard, executive director of competition and strategy with the FCA, explains: As with our work on the wider CFD and binary options markets, we will act when we see poor products being sold to retail customers. These are complex contracts built on top of complex assets. Most consumers cannot reliably value derivatives based on unregulated crypto assets. Prices are extremely volatile and as we have seen globally, financial crime in crypto asset markets can lead to sudden and unexpected losses. It is therefore clear to us that these derivatives and exchange-traded notes are unsuitable investments for retail customers. To combat the volatility and price swings one often sees with crypto, stable currencies have become relatively popular over the past year. Stable coins are often tied to fiat currencies or assets like gold that have more sturdiness in the financial space. Thus, these coins are often less prone to fluctuations. At the same time, crypto is designed to give investors a chance to significantly build their wealth. Stable currencies, given their lack of movement, ultimately get in the way of this ideology, so while they do offer more safety when it comes to investing, their lack of risk prevents one from building their net worth at a quickened pace. At press time, Woolard is warning everyone against the utilization of Libra, Facebooks new cryptocurrency, which he says is likely to stir heavy regulation.

BTC seems to have completed a downside correction and it could continue above $12,000. In the past few days, bitcoin price corrected lower significantly below $12,000 against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded as high as $13,850 and later corrected below the $12,000 and $11,000 levels. There was also a close below the $11,000 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Finally, the price even broke the $10,000 level before it found support near the $9,700 and $9,680 levels. A swing low was formed at $9,673 and the price recently started a fresh increase. It broke the $10,000 and $10,500 resistance levels. Moreover, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $13,847 high to $9,673 swing low. It is now trading nicely above the $11,000 level. However, there are a few important hurdles near the $11,500 and $11,600 levels. Besides, there is a major declining channel in place with resistance near $11,500 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. Above the channel resistance, the next hurdle could be near the $11,750 level. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $13,847 high to $9,673 swing low.

In 2018, a report emerged (authored by Texas finance professor John Griffin) that suggested bitcoins rally during the prior year had been the result of individuals using tether to purchase bitcoin whenever it showed any sort of deviation or fall from its previous highs. This allegedly tied bitcoin to USD, as tether is a supposed stable currency, and allowed the currency to spike further. It was a case of manipulation 101. Since that time, crypto skeptics have stated that tether is once again in the mix, but Kraken CEO Jesse Powell says otherwise. He dismisses the claims and states that bitcoins good fortune as of late has little to do with the stable coin and more with growing market demands. In an official interview, Powell explains: I dont have inside knowledge of whats happening at tether, but I can tell you that historically, when youve seen growth in the supply of tether, weve seen growth in the supply of U.S. dollars coming onto Kraken, and other exchanges would report the same. He further states that despite its growing reputation, tether is a relatively small currency thats incapable of bringing about heavy change to bitcoin and the general crypto space: Recently, weve had massive inflows of fiat currency, so I believe the tether prints are a result of new fiat coming in I dont feel like tether is artificially inflating the price of bitcoin. I think tether is actually a small part of the total fiat supply among all the exchanges. Bitcoin still largely dominates the crypto space, and is the number one form of cryptocurrency by market cap. It is unrivaled by even its number two competitor Ethereum, which at press time, is only trading in the high $200 range. Compare this with bitcoin, which despite being down for the count, is still trading for nearly $11,000 at the time of writing. Tether does not even come close to bitcoin or Ethereum, and Powell doesnt see the coin as having any major influence on the former entity. He says that bitcoins behavior as of late is the result of varying behavior on exchanges, and the fact that many more customers have sought to get involved in crypto over the past several weeks: There are days when you see the price going up ten percent a day. You can bet all the exchanges are onboarding fifty to a hundred thousand new users a day [when that happens]. That is what is driving up the price. Its a huge retail demand and all the media attention on it, not tether. ","['bitcoin', 'Jesse Powell', 'kraken', 'tether']"

While this isnt as strong as where it stood earlier in the week, its still miles better than where its been in the past  particularly before April of 2019. As June comes to an end and were about to take our first step towards July, we can look at bitcoins behavior over these last 30 days and assume what may occur in the coming weeks. Bitcoin, as we all remember, was trapped in darkness for most of 2018. Lets rephrase that  all of 2018. It was an uncomfortable sight, especially considering that the currency had reached its all-time high of nearly $20,000 just months prior around Christmas of 2017. In November of 2018, the currency took a real nasty turn, dropping into the mid-$3,000 range after a controversial bitcoin cash hard fork took place that sent the granddaddy of crypto spiraling into oblivion. Things lasted this way for many months, and several traders and enthusiasts thought the end of bitcoin had finally arrived. Nobody expected what occurred just five months later in April, when the currency rose to the $5,000 range.At first, many of us thought it was a hoax or fluke of some sort. After all, it had been a long time before bitcoin had even touched the $5,000 range. This was surely some sort of mistake, and it probably wouldnt take long for the currency to fall back to where it was before. But the opposite occurred. Instead, bitcoin rose to $6,000 then $7,000 then $8,000. Despite several obstacles that were still in its way (i.e. a Binance hack that saw more than $40 million in BTC units disappear overnight), the currency was on a role to get itself out of the gutter and return to trading in top form. Enthusiasts and crypto investors everywhere exploded with joy at the thought that bitcoin would once again be trading in the five-figure range, and this later occurred in early June when the currency spiked beyond the $10,000 mark. From there, $11,000 and $12,000 respectively, until it finally peaked (for now) at the $13,000 range just a few days ago. Since then, it has undergone something of a correction and fallen back into the $11,000 range, but this isnt something we should worry about just yet. After all, in May of this year, the currency rose to $9,000 temporarily before falling back down into the $7,000 range. It has since added more than $4,000 to its overall price, meaning that these corrections occur, especially when the rises happen so swiftly and without warning. Granted bitcoin can retain this behavior, July is likely to give us even more spikes, and enthusiasts probably have a lot to look forward to. We saw gains of roughly $6,000 in June. Should this keep up, we could see bitcoin spike to $20,000 again much sooner than we all anticipated. ","['Binance', 'bitcoin', 'bitcoin correction', 'bitcoin price']"

At press time, the currency is trading for just over $11,100, though this is small beans compared to the $12,200 it was trading for yesterday. Its even smaller given that roughly a week ago, it was trading for nearly $13,600. Despite all of this, bitcoin is still gaining, though this month has been marred by some serious corrections. Last Wednesday, bitcoin dropped down to about $10,400, which means the currency ultimately lost about 12 percent of its overall value, though this isnt something we should consider abnormal. Remember in May when bitcoin rose to $9,000 then fell into the $7,000 range temporarily? These corrections happen, especially when price spikes occur rather suddenly, which they have, and we cant assume that bitcoins future is about to be clouded. After all, bitcoin later rose beyond $9,000 and then some. Blockchain Capitals Spencer Bogart says this is all completely normal, and explains why such corrections are not only common, but even necessary if bitcoin is going to be a stronger currency. In a recent interview, he states: For one, this is natural for any kind of asset that has fixed supply but fluctuating demand, particularly one like bitcoin thats early on in its life cycle. This certainly applies to the granddaddy of crypto. It is said that only 21 million units of bitcoin will ever be in existence, and already there are about 18 million in circulation. Were likely to see mining top off in the coming years, which means bitcoins value is likely to change as this mining comes to an end. Bitcoin has also seen the demand surrounding it alter. In 2018, for example, everyone lost interest thanks to its ongoing price drops. Since April of this year, when spikes began occurring again, people have grown more accustomed to bitcoin and see it as a much stronger store of value. Bogart explains: People assume youre buying this art because its beautiful, right? Youre buying this vintage Ferrari because maybe youre going to drive it around. These things dont adorn peoples walls. Theyre not driven on the streets. They sit in vaults and in warehouses, so theyre a store of value and a scarce asset because there will be no new Picasso paintings, [and] there will be no new vintage Ferraris. Despite his confidence in crypto and bitcoin, Bogart says that anyone interested still needs to remain careful. He suggests purchasing only a small percentage of bitcoin or crypto so that it amounts to about one percent of your portfolio. From there, you shouldnt touch it for at least three years after buying it: Thats strictly a purchase in a scarce asset thats used as a store of value to preserve capital over time.

The plight of the twins first came to light in the Oscar-winning film The Social Network, which detailed the creation of Facebook, arguably the worlds largest and most used social media platform. The twins and the film allege that Facebook was originally their idea, and that Mark Zuckerberg  current head executive of the company  was merely a programmer that they asked to do technical work and coding for the system. However, the film suggests that Zuckerberg created the platform and passed the idea off as his own, which resulted in both the twins and Zuckerberg heading to court. Zuckerberg ultimately settled the dispute with the Winklevoss brothers, and all parties went their merry ways. Since that time, both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have moved on to establish solid reputations in both the crypto and monetary spaces. They have since created whats known as the Gemini Exchange in New York, a cryptocurrency trading platform and one of the first recipients of the now infamous New York-based Bitlicense which many companies and traders said halted innovation in the cryptocurrency space and within the Big Apple. The twins havent allowed this to get in their way. They are also solid bitcoin investors and have experienced heavy gains in their cryptocurrency fortunes over the past few months since bitcoin first began its present bull rally in April of 2019. At press time, their combined net worth  which is comprised mostly of digital assets  has reached $1.45 billion. Pretty serious, considering this same worth was approximately $645 million at the beginning of the year. In addition, the market stability and trends affecting bitcoin this time around appear a lot more legitimate than was witnessed in 2017. Qiao Wang, director of product at the crypto data startup Messari, explains: The confidence is certainly returning. The difference between now and the last time bitcoin reached $13,000 is that the market is currently far more rational Bitcoin is digital gold and a hedge against inflationary economic crises. If investors believe in this thesis, they should slowly accumulate bitcoin and hold it for years to come. They should not go all-in or trade frequently. Larry Cermak, director of research at the Block, boasts similar sentiment, saying that the crypto market has become somewhat tame and rational in recent months. He states: Theres no evidence that its coming from one country. If I were to make an educated guess, the rally was started by larger investors and sustained by some retail investors.

It seems Facebooks new form of crypto, Libra, is now being subjected to the same accusations. Facebook Coin will allegedly be a stable currency, meaning it will be tied to USD so that it is not vulnerable to the same price swings and volatility that one often sees with mainstream forms of crypto such as bitcoin. Stable currencies are often meant to bring more sturdiness to the world of crypto and its investors, but sometimes, they can pave the way for more questions than answers. One such example involves tether. Recently, Live Bitcoin News published an article suggesting  based on testimony from a known crypto skeptic  that tether could potentially be behind bitcoins second price rally, which began in April of this year. As we all remember, bitcoin began spiking a few months ago and reached $5,000, a price it hadnt touched in several months. At press time, this figure has more than doubled, and bitcoin is trading for just shy of $12,000 per unit. While this is certainly good news, it is being suggested that tether is once again being used to push the bitcoin price and exacerbate the crypto scene. This first occurred during the bitcoin rally of 2017, when bitcoin rose to its all-time high price of nearly $20,000. The evidence was first suggested in a report submitted by Texas finance professor John Griffin, and there are worries that the same scenario is happening again. Even though Facebook Coin is a stable currency, it is still being subjected to the same concerns as bitcoin that it will be used for illicit purposes. Several members of the U.S. House of Representatives are now questioning FinCEN  the Financial Crime Enforcement Network  about how Facebooks Libra will potentially be utilized. Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democrat from Missouri, has issued the following the statement: Weve seen the significant damage that foreign adversaries and bad actors have wrought on our democracy through Facebooks platform, and that was simply through messaging and advertising. Before we allow such a giant corporation to begin processing millions to billions of financial transactions, we must study these issues and ensure we have the tools and guardrails in place to deter terrorists, extremists, and/or enemies from utilizing such a platform to do harm to our nation Now that were seeing a giant corporation like Facebook  which has already shown an inability to identify and impede these kinds of actors at an acceptable level  creating its own virtual currency called Libra, it cannot be understated the importance of Congress and financial transmitters to be proactive in utilizing the newest and most powerful technologies to ensure the financial system is not being used improperly.

According to recent stock charts, the company has skyrocketed by more than 300 percent since the beginning of the year, and securities are standing at more than $14 per share, a significant spike from the $3.84 price they were experiencing last February. This is all a testament to the strength of bitcoin. Once a product of several hit-and-run schemes, bitcoin would often surge or experience solid price spikes only to be hit by some form of unfortunate news that ultimately made it topple into oblivion. Sometimes, it would take weeks or even months to see bitcoins original price return to fruition. To be fair, this is still happening with bitcoin, though the currencys newfound strength and thick skin are helping dropped prices recuperate much quicker. Less than 24 hours ago, bitcoin was trading for about $10,400  a $3,000 drop from where it had been trading the day before. Having fallen from $13,600 to the $10,000 range, the granddaddy of crypto was allegedly marred by the news that Bitrue, a Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange, had been overrun with hackers seeking to steal nearly $5 million in both Cardano and Ripple funds. The hit did affect bitcoins price allegedly, but only for a short while. Here we are less than a day later, and the currency has already added another $1,400 to its price. While theres still nearly $3,000 to go before the currency is back where it stood roughly 48 hours prior, the news is further proof that bitcoins maturity has expanded faster than any trader could have anticipated. The coin is still on the rise and moving much faster than it did three or even two years ago. The fact that Grayscale is doing so well also suggests that despite these hits, trust for bitcoin is growing. Many no longer view it as a speculative asset, but rather as a formidable means of value storage. This is shown in a new report submitted by investment and financial editor John Dobosz of Forbes fame, who suggests that bitcoin is outperforming much larger assets at press time including USD, oil and even gold. He explains: The total gain for GBTC, which tracks bitcoin pretty accurately, is up 341 percent. What comes in second best? You would have been okay with oil, even though oil has eaten dust and other particles in the last few weeks. Oil is up 12.8 percent The stock formed what you would call a double bottom in technical analysis. The belief is that the market had a chance to take the stock lower, but it didnt. After the double bottom, the thing took off The third period of the pattern is often the most exaggerated of growth. Since then, its been manic.

The good news is that the currency is rebounding from yesterdays drop. After trading at $13,600 for much of Wednesday, everybodys favorite form of cryptocurrency sank deep into the pit of $10,000 for virtually no reason. During the early morning hours of June 27, bitcoin was trading at approximately $10,400, having lost approximately $3,000 from its price within just a few hours. Some attributed the fall to the recent hack on Bitrue in Singapore. A popular cryptocurrency exchange, it appeared that hackers ultimately gained control of the companys reserves and stole more than $4 million in assorted Ripple and Cardano funds. While none of the companys bitcoin stashes were stolen, the hack may have had an impact on the granddaddy of crypto nonetheless. At press time, however, the currency is up to approximately $11,800, having added more than $1,400 to its price since yesterdays early afternoon hours. While theres still nearly $2,000 to add back on if it wants to be back to where it was 48 hours ago, its living proof that bitcoins stamina is more market-fueled this time around. That the coins maturity has grown, and its going to take a little more than the hack of a foreign exchange to potentially bring down the mother of cryptocurrency. For that, many enthusiasts are feeling hopeful. Unfortunately, it has been suggested that the stable currency tether is at it again when it comes to pushing bitcoins current price. This was something many traders thought they were done with, but some analysts claim otherwise. Tethers alleged ties to bitcoin were first introduced last year in a report issued by Texas-based finance professor John Griffin, who authored a document suggesting that tether owners were manipulating the cryptocurrencys price and potentially driving it up through superficial means. The idea expressed in the report was that tether owners were continuing to purchase tether coins which they would then use to purchase bitcoin, driving up its price and tying it to USD, which is the fiat currency that purportedly supports the tether currency. This is grade-A manipulation, and the news comes by way of long-time crypto skeptic Nouriel Roubini, who expressed on Twitter: When a study shows that 95pc of all Bitcoin transactions are fake, while you got 5,000+ pump/dump schemes and the mother of all fiat printing/manipulating machines behind Tether running (another billion of fake dollars soon created out of air), how can you believe any crypto b/s? At the same time, other sources are suggesting that bitcoins current rise to fame is being influenced more by market trends than manipulation this time around, which means bitcoin has developed a little more of a backbone. Either way, its unclear whos correct. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Bitrue', 'tether']"

If you want to invest in crypto but are nervous about the prospects, stable currencies could be the answer. Now, theyre earning an even larger boost through companies like Coin Source, a Texas-based operator of cryptocurrency ATMs. The venture recently announced that it would be adding the stable asset Dai to its many ATMs located throughout the southern United States this summer. The addition of the coin is in preparation for what the company calls a widespread remittance program, in which workers will be able to send money home to their families in the form of Dai or other cryptocurrencies that they can trade or sell. Travis Gough, chief product officer at Coin Source, comments: In remittances, people want to save as much value and they dont want to be subjected to the high volatility that youre seeing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that can be very speculative. Price swings are a persistent worry in the crypto space, and likely never to leave enthusiasts minds fully. At the same time, its easy to suggest that currencies like bitcoin are suddenly easier to accept given these swings are now traveling north. Since April of this year, bitcoin has been enjoying a serious bull run, having jumped by nearly 200 percent in just the last three months alone. After a lengthy period of traveling through the doldrums at the mid-$3,000 range, the currency began its new string of price spikes last April with a sudden (and unexpected) jump to $5,000. The good news this time around is that bitcoins sudden behavior is likely being sparked more by market trends, which will make this bull run more stable than the one that occurred in 2017, reportedly the subject of manipulation by users of the stable currency tether. Along with bitcoin, currencies like Litecoin have also surged in price, heightening the crypto spaces present levels of legitimacy. The Coin Source remittance service  which will at first be available to customers only in the United States  will allow ATMs to transfer Dai and other digital assets between wallets. Once a customer receives funds, they can forward them to the wallets of selected parties granted those parties have satisfied all of Coin Sources know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Receiving individuals can then confirm the funds and trade or sell them accordingly. All transactions occurring by way of Coin Source are recorded onto the Ethereum blockchain. At press time, the company operates more than 230 ATMs in nearly 30 states and in Washington D.C. ","['bitcoin', 'Coin Source', 'Dai']"

Many traders and enthusiasts are looking at the granddaddy of cryptocurrency with a bit of confusion. After all, this isnt the first time the currency has enjoyed such a serious rise to the top, but the last time ended in serious pratfalls that caused the currency to lose nearly 80 percent of its value in less than a year. Naturally, there are some concerns regarding the future of bitcoin. Will the asset plunge into darkness as it did during 2018, or will this bull rally be different somehow? What can traders and crypto fans expect in the coming months? According to one source, this bull rally is supported more by market trends, suggesting the currencys latest behavior has a thicker backbone that the one that occurred in 2017. As we all likely remember, bitcoin struck its all-time high of nearly $20,000 during the latter half of that year, though serious drops in its price began to occur during the first few weeks of 2018. It later emerged from a report issued by John Griffin  a finance professor  that bitcoins alleged ties with tether were what did the currency in. In what basically turned out to be a case of fraud 101, the report stated that many industry players had been using tether to purchase bitcoin whenever the asset fell by even a small or minimal margin. This worked to potentially tie the coin to USD  as tether is a stable currency  and boost its price enough to instill market mania and frequent bull surges that inspired more and more people to buy. Mati Greenspan, a senior analyst at cryptocurrency exchange e-Toro, explains in an interview: The first time that bitcoin breached this level to the upside was in a frenzy of fear-of-missing-out (FOMO), as most of the world was just learning what this new digital asset is all about. This time, however, the rise seems much more sustainable and the currency price more justifiable given the current levels of awareness and adoption. Indeed, education regarding bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general is up, while companies like Flexa are working to make it easier for retailers and merchants to accept bitcoin and its altcoin cousins as legitimate means of payment. Thus, the goals of cryptocurrencies are coming to fruition, while individuals no longer view digital assets as purely speculative. Still, bitcoin remains largely popular with specific types of audiences, mainly younger generations and millennials. George Michalopoulos, a portfolio manager with Typhon Capital Management in Chicago, Illinois, explains: Traditional market participants may be more skeptical of [bitcoin] than millennial day traders.

BTC is showing a lot of positive signs and it could continue to surge in the near term towards $13,000. In the past few days, bitcoin price strengthened a lot above $10,000 against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair surged above the main $10,500 and $11,000 resistance levels. There was also a close above the $10,000 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). It opened the doors for more gains and the price climbed above the $12,000 resistance. Finally, the price spiked above the $12,200 level and a new yearly high was formed at $12,268. The price remains in a strong uptrend and it may even climb above the $12,500 level in the near term. An initial support on the downside is near the $12,000 level. The 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $10,994 low to $12,268 high is near $11,967 to act as a support. Moreover, there is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $11,630 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. The trend line support holds the key near the $11,600 level. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $10,994 low to $12,268 high is also near the $11,630 level. Therefore, if there is a downside correction, the price is likely to find support near $12,000 or $11,600. If there is a downside break, the price may test the $11,250 support area.  Looking at the chart, bitcoin price is clearly trading with a strong bullish bias above $11K and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). The price action suggests chances of more gains above the $12,500 level. In the mentioned case, the price may even test the $13,000 resistance level.

In other words, the bank is willing to remain open to Facebook Coin and consider its advantages, but the company shouldnt see this as an opportunity to simply do whatever it wants. The bank is looking to instill strict regulation when it comes to cryptocurrencies, though it admits that for such regulation to be successful, the effort must be global. Cryptocurrencies are garnering mixed reactions from critics and traditional monetary establishments, and Facebooks Libra is privy to these reactions. Many believe that financial policies must be put in place if the currency is to thrive and do its job accordingly. Facebook has faced heavy scrutiny in the past for its ties to Cambridge Analytica and for selling customers private data to third parties, and many dont trust the platform to handle their personal financial information. When it comes to implementing such regulation, however, Carney doesnt think the bank is in the best position. He acknowledges that while the institution has power, its not as technically sound as the banks situated in neighboring regions. At a recent summit, he commented: The U.K. is still a long way behind countries such as Sweden, where users can make direct, free and real-time bank-to-bank payments in-store and online with a text or a scan of a QR code. He did mention, however, that: Libra, if it achieves its ambitions, would be systemically important. Right now, it appears the Bank of England is taking baby steps that will allow it to compete technologically with other institutions. For example, it recently submitted a report showing that in-store cash transactions have decreased rapidly, while online digital payments are more popular than ever. Thus, the bank is opening access to its balance sheet, allowing new payment providers and giving users access to payment firms and further digital means. The bank suggests that this will improve the transmission of monetary policy and increase competition. Carney has also expressed concern over the carbon emissions and environmental impacts that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have on Earths atmosphere. Recently, Live Bitcoin News reported that the mining of bitcoin releases as much carbon as the entire city of Las Vegas. In addition, it has been reported that China is considering a full ban on crypto mining given the alleged problems it poses to the environment. At press time, the bank is undergoing a series of tests designed to better understand the carbon footprints of incoming financial technology, one of which is cryptocurrency. The bank is also seeking to reduce its own carbon footprint by more than two-thirds within ten years. ","['bank of england', 'cryptocurrency', 'Facebook', 'Mark Carney']"

Many arguments have been made in defense of the stability of the coin. After more than a year of trudging its way through the doldrums, bitcoin ultimately rose to the $5,000 range in early April of 2019, something that many enthusiasts and traders thought would be out of the question. Prior to that, bitcoin had been trapped in the $3,500 range for several months, though it had been slowly slinking further and further into oblivion for the previous 10 months. One of the biggest arguments thus far for bitcoins meteoric rise is the fact that Facebook is entering the cryptocurrency space. Glen Goodman  author of The Crypto Trader  recently stated in an interview: Bullish investors believe if Facebooks crypto Libra becomes a trusted payment mechanism, then people are also more likely to trust bitcoin as a reliable long-term store of value. A digital gold, if you will. Many traders will be looking to take some profits off the table now, but its worth remembering that last time bitcoins price broke through $10,000, it then hit its all-time high of nearly $20,000 just 16 days later. Apparently, Mark Zuckerberg is giving bitcoin its biggest boost in history, but this isnt quite the reason, according to another source which suggests Indias alleged (and upcoming) ban on cryptocurrencies. One of the big problems with telling someone they cant have something is that now, theyre going to do just about anything to obtain it. If you tell a child that he or she cant have a cookie and that the cookie jar is off limits, theyre going to wait until youre not looking or out of the room to stick their hand inside. Tell someone what to do, and theyll naturally want to oppose your orders. Apparently, this is whats occurring in India, which has been debating a potential ban on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies for some time. Many regulators hold the belief that crypto paves the way for financial crime including money laundering and tax evasion. These are old arguments to say the least, but still beliefs that many policymakers hold fresh in their minds. Thus, the country is considering outlawing the use of cryptocurrency altogether. Apparently, recent regulation preventing banks from working with crypto businesses isnt enough. As a result, the desire and need for bitcoin has been climbing steadily in India as more and more people have sought to attain or retrieve it. Nischal Shetty, chief executive of India-based crypto exchange WaxirX, explains that Facebooks pushes for crypto could potentially get in the way of its initiating a full ban, and for that reason, Libra can be considered quite the savior.

This is huge for the granddaddy of all crypto, and its fair to say that a milestone has been hit. For the past few days, many analysts have been predicting that $10,000 was right around the corner right after it became clear that bitcoin had surpassed the $9,000 resistance it had been struggling with for so long. Initially, the $9,000 mark had been passed twice by the currency, but bitcoin only managed to stay past this position on a temporary basis, as each surge resulted in an immediate fall soon after to the $8,000 and $7,000 ranges respectively. The currency, however, is doing better than it has in quite some time and has moved into a new 15-month high. The bullish behavior is continuing steadily, and there are no signs of an early withdrawal. This raises a lot of questions, the first being, Will bitcoin potentially reach its all-time high once again by the end of the year? As we all remember, bitcoin (nearly) struck the $20,000 mark in December of 2017, giving everyone a happy little gift for the holiday season. In addition, bitcoin struck this position in a relatively short amount of time, given where it was trading just a few months prior. In September of that year, for example, bitcoin was only trading in the $5,000 range, suggesting it had managed to quadruple its price in roughly three months. Quite a move when you think about it. This time, the currency has roughly six months to go before the holiday season arrives, which means it has more time to build itself up. Putting this into perspective, a $20,000 strike isnt out of the question. Granted bitcoin can keep this momentum up, its not improbable to assume that the currency may go beyond its original high and set an entirely new record for itself. Maybe $25,000? Well have to wait and see. In the meantime, another question arises regarding Tom Lee of Fundstrat fame. Lee took a lot of flack in 2018 when he predicted that bitcoin would end the year in the $20,000 and $15,000 ranges respectively. However, now it looks like bitcoin could potentially enter that territory, giving rise to a very serious thought: is possible that Lee was correct all along, and that his predictions were maybe just a little off? If bitcoin does strike the $20,000 or $25,000 marks by the end of 2019, Lees predictions will have come true  just a little later than originally stated. Regardless, it seems Lee will ultimately be positioned to thumb his nose at any doubters while loudly chanting, I told you so. As long as bitcoin keeps this up, we probably arent going to mind.

It has reached a new high for the year, and it would seem like $10,000 is right around the corner. The asset has been performing wonders as of late, but it appears the currency has managed to break and surpass all previous resistance. For example, one of the biggest problems facing bitcoin over the past few weeks was the $9,000 mark. This proved to be a heavy region of resistance, and bitcoin experienced several issues trying to surpass it. It did once or twice, but only briefly. These spurts ultimately caused the currency to fall back into the $8,000 and $7,000 ranges respectively. One of the big things likely contributing to the recent jump is the surge in bitcoin interest thats been growing since last April. Thats when the currency ultimately rose to $5,000 for the first time in several months. Prior to that, bitcoin had been in a serious slump for roughly one year. It was in January of 2018 when the currency fell from its all-time high of nearly $20,000, and it began experiencing solid drops from there, the biggest one coming in November. This was when bitcoin lost more than 80 percent of its value and fell into the $3,500 range. Many enthusiasts were convinced this was where bitcoin would remain, and further ideas of price jumps were, sadly, non-existent. However, April of 2019 brought about fresh hope and interest in the coin as it suddenly surged by nearly $2,000. It was a powerful sight that got everyone excited again, and the currency has been on a never-ending roll since then. Data from Google Trends shows that there were more bitcoin-related internet searches in May of this year than during any other month. This suggests that everyones desire for bitcoin has suddenly returned, and the currency is experiencing a whole new wave of popularity it hasnt been subjected to in some time. But there are other contributing factors as well. Though it hasnt been released yet, people are still as tantalized by Bakkt as ever. The new cryptocurrency trading platform owned by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has everyone on pins and needles and waiting desperately for a newfound change, while companies like Fidelity Investments have seemingly attracted several new customers with their digital asset trading firms. In addition, bitcoin has a halving thats set to occur relatively soon. This will make the currency far more valuable, as fewer coins will be mined and extracted, reducing those in circulation. Something rarer is likely to carry more value throughout its journey, so were likely to witness further bitcoin buys during the coming months. With crypto, nothing is ever set in stone, but for the time being, bitcoin is clearly enjoying a bullish boom that we can all sit back and enjoy. ","['Bakkt', 'bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'fidelity']"

Wright has consistently claimed that hes Satoshi Nakamoto, the alleged creator of bitcoin, though these claims have often been scoffed at and met with disbelief. Now, Wright is suing to ensure people know his name. Many of us likely remember a convention held last year that many crypto industry leaders attended or spoke at. One of those speakers was Craig Wright, who was ultimately interrupted by Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin, who had been sitting in the audience, stood up and asked why Wright, a fraud, was being allowed to speak at the conference. Apparently, this didnt go over well with Wright, who now says hes planning to sue Buterin and all those who have doubted his claims for defamation. He stated to Bloomberg recently: This will give me the chance to prove my credentials in front of a judge, rather than being judged by Twitter. The trouble is that Wright is doubted by some of the biggest names in crypto. One of those names is John McAfee, and while McAfee has experienced his fair share of controversy over the past years, particularly with his recent announcement to run for president, all statements must be considered as part of the case at hand. McAfee claims he knows the real Satoshi Nakamoto, and he says its not Wright. He states: I am going to tell the truth no matter what the consequences are. Ive been sued over 200 times in my life. I am not afraid of getting sued. However, others are quite sure of Wrights statements and say that he is responsible for the creation of bitcoin. One of those individuals is John Matonis, the founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation. In a recent blog post, Matonis says he sat down with Wright, who gave him a private demonstration of a signature allegedly used by Nakamoto. Matonis then writes: The proof is conclusive, and I have no doubt that Craig Steven Wright is the person behind the Bitcoin technology. Sadly, this only spread more doubt throughout the crypto space. One such doubter is Peter Todd, a bitcoin key developer. Upon reading the news of the signature, he took to Vices Motherboard and wrote: It would be like if I was trying to prove that I was George Washington and to do that, provided a photocopy of the Constitution and said, Look, I have George Washingtons signature. It is alleged that the creator of bitcoin owns about $9 billion in the currency, much of which has never been moved. Many critics have asked Wright to shift some of these coins to other accounts as a means of proving his claims, though Wright has refused many times.

This is huge news for the granddaddy of crypto, but many believe that the currency is just getting started. One of those people is bitcoin bull and crypto analyst at Fundstrat Tom Lee. As one of bitcoins biggest advocates, Lee is no stranger to crazy predictions centered around bitcoins alleged rise to fame. Throughout 2018, Lee was consistently claiming that bitcoin would ultimately spike to $25,000 by the end of the year. Despite 2018 being arguably the worst 12 months for bitcoin and crypto in general, Lee never put his guns down, though he did draw back on his initial prediction, later assuming bitcoin would rise to $20,000 and then $15,000 respectively. Bitcoin has been on a stellar rise since April of this year. It was during this month that it rose beyond $5,000 for the first time in roughly five months, something many traders and former enthusiasts thought could never happen again. However, it has since nearly doubled that price and has continued its epic rise faster than anyone could have anticipated. In a recent interview, Lee commented that were deep in the bull market, and that bitcoin would surpass its $20,000 all-time high. In addition, hes confident that bitcoins price could go as high as $40,000 in the coming years granted its use cases improve. One of the big things pushing bitcoins price, Lee believes, is Facebooks recent announcement of the Libra Network. He states that Facebook shouldnt be viewed as an entity thats stealing the limelight, but rather as one of bitcoins biggest soldiers in the ongoing war for recognition. He states: The Facebook announcement is a complete validation that mainstream is now focused on cryptocurrencies. I think it really destroys those arguments that say, I believe in blockchain, not bitcoin I think it is more targeted at stable coin and creating a new kind of banking system, and its very complementary to bitcoin. I think this is a bullish development for bitcoin. I think its bad for stable coins and anyone whos been trying to do decentralized finance. He also posed reasoning as to why Facebook was now attracting some bad press from both financial institutions and Congress, stating: One thing to keep in mind [is] Facebooks annual revenue per user is probably $50. That might be a little high, but an average bank generates close to $1,000 per user, so Facebook has a 20x upside to their customer model if they start doing banking services, and so I can see why banks arent really enthusiastic about this. In the end, crypto is designed to give people a stronger sense of financial independence, while banks typically take that away. ","['bitcoin', 'Facebook', 'Tom Lee']"

Bitcoin is the granddaddy of all crypto, and never likely to be rivaled in terms of market cap, widespread popularity or adaptability. While Facebook Coin is an ambitious feat, bitcoin is still king and likely to remain so for some time. Nevertheless, Zuckerberg seems hellbent on making Facebook the head of the financial arena. Where the idea originally comes from is questionable, considering this is a 360 degree turn for what could once be deemed the largest social media platform in the world. The company has done wonders when it comes to hooking up old friends and relatives, but finance? Really? What makes Facebook think it can suddenly dominate the global monetary infrastructure with virtually no experience? Interestingly, Facebooks level of naivete when it comes to financial policy seems to be working in its favor. The company has already garnered millions of dollars in support from varying business partners and has experienced booming stocks as the result of its announcement. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets claims: We view Facebooks introduction of the Libra currency as a potential watershed moment for the company and global adoption of crypto. In terms of scale and importance, we believe this new financial infrastructure could be viewed similar with Apples introduction of iOS to developers over a decade ago. While financial players in America are relatively enthused about Facebook entering the crypto space, those in Europe are less than thrilled. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire has commented that Facebooks Libra Network must not become a sovereign currency. He has also warned citizens that Facebooks financial services should not replace the use of traditional fiat. Zuckerberg has been pushing the notion of trust ever since the companys association with Cambridge Analytica. A portion of the currencys whitepaper explains how the currency will be supported: To help instill trust in a new currency and gain widespread adoption during its infancy, it was guaranteed that a countrys notes could be traded in for real assets, such as gold. Instead of backing Libra with gold, though, it will be backed by a collection of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks. U.S. regulators seem to agree that what Facebook is doing is somewhat revolutionary. However, they arent willing to take any chances, and state that Facebook will not be privy to any special privileges. David Marcus, head of the companys blockchain program and former exec at PayPal, states: It is very clear people dont want their financial data from an account to be comingled with social data or to be used for other purposes.

While this was discussed yesterday, the currency ultimately fell back down into the $8,000 range briefly during the days latter half, suggesting that $9,000 resistance was still too much for the asset to handle. For the most part, $9,000 has been somewhat of a problem for bitcoin over the past several weeks. It has surpassed the mark twice only to fall back down, but this time, that resistance appears to have been broken for good. News came about this morning that bitcoin is back above $9,000, and this time around, its staying there. Its risen from yesterday and sticking to the same bullish guns its been touting since early April of 2019. Analysts vouching for the coin say bitcoins price rise has a lot to do with Facebooks entry into the cryptocurrency space. As we all know by now, Facebook is developing two major additions to the monetary space. The first is a digital currency its calling Facebook Coin. Users will be able to utilize the currency to make payments for both goods and services through the social media platform. In addition, Facebook Coin is slated to be a stable currency, meaning its tied to USD and less prone to the volatility and price swings one often sees with mainstream forms of crypto such as Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin. However, Facebook is also developing what its dubbed the Libra Network, which will allow users to pay for items with Facebook Coin through retailers websites that have Facebook login options. The system will be a massive payment network thats likely to spread through multiple states and countries and give Facebook status similar with popular credit cards such as Amex, Mastercard and Visa. Bitcoin is up by approximately 150 percent since early April of this year, but its behavior is rubbing off on several additional coins. Ethereum, for example, is now trading for 5.5 percent higher over the last 24 hours, while Litecoin is up by an even five percent. Speaking with Bloomberg, Brett McGonegal  CEO of Capital Link International  claims: The simple fact is that in a time when people are looking for some sort of haven or some hedge, money has found its way to [bitcoin]. The inflection point in any major play to a nascent asset class is the attachment point to institutional money. If institutional money starts to touch bitcoin, thats when you go much higher. In other words, many are beginning to see bitcoin as a solid investment, particularly institutional players. The days of viewing bitcoin as unsafe or weak are coming to an end. Its now comparable to stocks, gold and other mediums in which people seek to store their cash. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Facebook']"

At press time, its trading for well over $9,100. This is new milestone for the currency, considering how miserable 2018 was. Starting in January, bitcoin, as well as several other forms of crypto, began sinking into oblivion after reaching all-time highs in the year 2017. Many believed that the falls would be minor in the beginning and that bitcoin and other digital assets were merely undergoing soft forms of correction. After all, $20,000 per coin seems like too fast a feat in many ways. Several traders probably werent ready for bitcoins explosive behavior, so a drop of $1,000 or so probably wouldnt have much significance in the long run. Unfortunately, what nobody realized was that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would continue their falls for more than a year. Until March of 2019, bitcoin was trapped in the doldrums and seemed unable to move beyond the $4,000 mark, which is where it was trading at that time. The currency fell to the mid-$3,500 range in November, and it appeared that things werent going to change anytime soon. But we were wrong again. In April of 2019, bitcoin struck the $5,000 mark and began spiking faster than anyone could have anticipated. At the time of writing, it has nearly tripled its price since the beginning of the year, and enthusiasts couldnt be more pleased. In addition, the $9,000 line was a serious barricade for bitcoin, and was proving to be more resistance-laden than originally thought. However, bitcoin has now surpassed that resistance, and analysts are predicting that $10,000 may be around the corner granted the bulls can keep up their present momentum. Its interesting in the sense that just last week, bitcoin was trading in the $7,000 range. That means the coin has shot up by nearly $2,000 in a relatively short period. The strength and stamina of the coin is quite profound, but what were seeing more than anything is a growing level of maturity never witnessed before in the coins behavior. For example, Live Bitcoin News recently published an article that bitcoins carbon emissions, according to a new study, are comparable to those released by the city of Las Vegas. Thats a lot of emissions when you think about it, and three years ago, theres a good chance the coin would have likely suffered from such news. The price would have gone down, and things would have taken a negative turn. This time, however, the currency has struck a new chord and added to its price. This is the second time this happens in 2019, the first being when Binance was hacked and lost $40 million in BTC. The currency rose than dwindled, and its maturity is starting to solidify.

With over 300 percent in gains since the start of 2019, Litecoin is indeed carving out a new name for itself in the crypto space, but that doesnt mean we should take anything away from bitcoin, the granddaddy of them all. At press time, the currency is trading for over $8,800. It is once again well within reach of $9,000, which many analysts predict is likely to come soon. Recently, the asset did strike the $9,000 chord, only to see its price sink immediately after likely due to a massive selloff that occurred, though the fact that it could reach such a position is a positive step in the right direction. Senior analyst at cryptocurrency exchange e-Toro commented that with Litecoins sudden rally, expecting a bitcoin rally for this week wouldnt be out of the question, and thus far, he seems to be right. Just last week, the currency was trading in the $7,000 range, meaning bitcoin has added well over $1,000 to its price in a very short period. Interestingly, some of the highest (though relatively indirect) praise for bitcoin is coming from JPMorgan, a financial institution headed by Jamie Dimon, who is a well-known bitcoin hater. In the past, Dimon has called bitcoin a fraud that was worse than tulips. However, he later surprised everyone with the announcement that JPMorgan would be launching JPM Coin, a stable currency that customers could use with the banks authorization. This time, however, a new report is being issued by the financial establishment that claims the importance of bitcoin futures is far more important than anyone could imagine. The report was issued to rebuke information presented by Bitwise, which said that most of the bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading volumes reported by cryptocurrency exchanges are either incorrect or exaggerated. Authored by researchers like Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the rebuttal claims: The importance of the listed futures market has been significantly understated. The report by Bitwise credits the traded futures as an important development in allowing short exposures that enabled arbitrageurs in properly engaging in arbitrage, and that the futures share of spot bitcoin volumes increased sharply in April and May. JPMorgan later issued a follow-up statement to the report, saying: The overstatement of trading volumes by cryptocurrency exchanges, and by implication the understatement of the importance of listed futures, suggests that market structure has likely changed considerably since the previous spike in bitcoin prices in end-2017 with a greater influence from institutional investors. Indeed, institutional investors do appear to be making stronger appearances in the crypto space, and bitcoin has ultimately become more mature, which likely explains why its suddenly doing so well.

The study examines how incorrect information is displayed as fact, and how this data can potentially impact the prices of various cryptocurrencies. One of the authors, Svitlana Volkova, presented her findings at this years Web Conference in San Francisco, California. She comments: Cryptocurrency is a very good proxy program for disinformation. The study, arguably, has its roots in the same ideas presented by U.S. President Donald Trump, who repeatedly says that information from both social and mainstream media platforms is fake. It appears many writers and news platforms are only publishing what they want their readers to think and hear, but there isnt necessarily truth to whats being said. This is dangerous in the sense that it misleads people. It leads them to believe the wrong data and can push negativity in the futures of various topics, in this case digital assets. Disinformation has been a big topic as of late, what with the presidential elections of both 2016 and 2020 in the U.S. Sadly, its sometimes difficult to develop algorithms or serious methods regarding whats true and what isnt in mainstream media. Thus, the study found it much easier to see whats incorrect on Reddit. Overall, several thousand comments were monitored on bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoin-based subreddits over the course of three years (between 2015 and 2018) by Volkova and her co-authors. Among the steps they took were checking to see how much volume these subreddits generated. They also examined how many people were leaving comments and how many individual people were involved. Not surprisingly, bitcoin proved to be the most popular topic amongst cryptocurrency participants. They noticed that as many as 3,600 separate messages and comments were posted to Reddit about bitcoin each day. Ethereum was in second place with 500 messages, while Monero was in third place with 380. However, Ethereum comments boasted the largest lifetimes, while Monero-centered messages had the longest median lifetimes. It was also discovered that Monero was five times more likely to generate commentary. Volkova states: These social signals are quite useful, and by incorporated them with machine and deep learning, we intend to build predictive models that hit on casual relationships between different variables, so we can explain model decision-making processes. The team is now working on various follow-up studies to see how this disinformation ultimately spreads to platforms like Twitter and Git Hub. Volkova mentions: Mitigation is harder. We have the models right now that can detect disinformation and can say, OK, look, this is not true. This is false or misleading. We can make the audience aware of the way disinformation spreads, but then we have to somehow coordinate with the social platform providers to actually make a difference.

According to a new study, bitcoins energy consumption is equivalent to that of the city of Las Vegas, Nevada and the country of Sri Lanka. On its own, bitcoin produces approximately 22 megatons of carbon emissions each year. This number doubles when all the remaining cryptocurrencies are accounted for. This is an argument that has swelled throughout the cryptocurrency space for some time. In fact, China has even put out a list of things its considering banning, as these items potentially hurt the atmosphere. One of those items is bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining, though to be fair, this has been on the list for a lengthy period and no action has ever been taken. The authors of the report say that local regulators have the potential to curb bitcoin mining emissions. The study suggests the following: Coal is fueling bitcoin. The question is how to prevent it, and thats up to local regulators. The good news is that the emissions discussed in the report are considerably less than what the authors originally thought they would be. At the same time, they are still asking key mining regions to take the emissions seriously and take necessary steps to lower them further. Overall, the amount of carbon emissions produced last year from the burning of fossil fuels was equal to about 37 billion tons. One of the studys writers, Christian Stoll, is very concerned about climate change, and while he says there are bigger problems contributing to changes in weather and the Earths overall climate, the burning of fossil fuels is not to be taken lightly. He explains: There are bigger factors contributing to climate change. However, the carbon footprint is big enough to make it worth discussing the possibility of regulating cryptocurrency mining in regions where power generation is especially carbon-intensive. He and his fellow researchers claim that most of the carbon emissions are coming from regions of Asia. This isnt a surprise. Countries like South Korea, the Philippines and China are massive bitcoin and cryptocurrency havens, which explains why most of the expelled energy would be here. At the same time, mining rigs are also prominent in Canada and certain parts of the United States thanks to lower energy bills. Thus, virtually every corner of the world appears vulnerable in some way. Not everyone is convinced by the reports findings. Bitcoin researcher Alex de Vries wasnt involved in the study but says that bitcoin transactions are relatively rare when compared with the transactions that occur through major credit card companies such as Visa and Mastercard. He wonders if the methods utilized to comprise the data are flawed, commenting: The folks in this study were very conservative on the energy side.

With these, readers will be able to follow the plights and changes of their favorite cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin, bitcoin and Ethereum. Theyll be able to monitor how theyre doing in the digital asset market and see how much their prices have changed from one day to the next. Moves like this are a testament to the growing popularity of cryptocurrency. If people werent interested in crypto and didnt want to witness the ongoing changes, these indexes wouldnt have been added. In addition, Bloomberg and Reuters boast wide levels of readership, so this is just more proof that crypto is suddenly reaching a larger audience. The indexes are being placed on both publications through a venture known as Crypto Index, which seeks to provide details regarding the top 100 digital assets in the market today. CEO VJ Angelo comments: The index is the culmination of three decades of experience in the financial services industry building indices. I have witnessed firsthand the growing demand for high-quality insight into the traditionally opaque and misunderstood area of cryptocurrency, which led me to create Crypto Index. Our index accounts for collective sentiments expressed on social media, in addition to complex data analysis of volume trades and predictive analytics. Crypto Index considers and utilizes information from approximately 1,800 separate crypto analyses to arrive at the data it provides for customers. According to a press release, information is collected from social media platforms, along with cryptocurrency exchanges, Telegram and GitHub. The release states: Over 33 Terabytes of data is analyzed to extract over 200 factors that create a refined ranking in the index, which is then put into a neutral network to create a final rating of coins. At press time, many cryptocurrencies are in the green and have gained solid hikes over the past few days. Bitcoin, for example, is currently trading at just shy of $8,200, which is about $400 higher than where it sat just a few days ago. Many had become worried that the recent bitcoin price recovery  which began in early April of this year  was suddenly coming to a standstill, but now the granddaddy of all crypto seems to be back on track with such an impressive gain. Angelo further comments that the cryptocurrency index will be updated each month with new information gathered from the mentioned resources. Furthermore, the crypto index is built to spot trading data that has been inflated. Such information is not likely to present accurate or correct figures, and thus will not be included in the indexs final data offerings. ","['bitcoin', 'Crypto Index', 'VJ Angelo']"

In a recent interview centered around cryptocurrency, the topic of bitcoin (naturally) came up. President of Brazil Bolsonaro took the stage, and when asked about the subject of bitcoin, he responded with the words: I dont know. Is it a coin? Bolsonaro has sought to remove all the previous cryptocurrency projects being established in Brazil from his predecessor, who was very big on digital assets and sought to create a new digital currency that indigenous people in the country could potentially use. The project would have allegedly cost Brazil nearly $12 million. Thats a lot of money for a country thats struggling financially At the same time, shutting down cryptocurrency projects may not be the best idea for Brazil, and for Bolsonaro to not understand bitcoin or know what it is can be considered somewhat inexcusable at this point. To be fair, Bolsonaros conservative ideals may be exactly what Brazil needs right now given its poverty status and the damage done to its natural resources over the past several years. A stricter presidency might do the country some good, but to get rid of crypto altogether could have disastrous consequences. For one thing, Brazil is one of the largest countries in the world. For it not to have access to crypto would easily put it behind in terms of financial and technological advancement. Several businesses and countries have worked hard to implement blockchain technology and instill crypto exchanges and applications for citizens to use. Ridding cryptocurrencies and bitcoin from the table will likely remove Brazils competitive edge in terms of monetary business and even supply chains operations. Right now, Brazil happens to be one of the most blockchain-prominent countries in Latin America. Bolsonaros words and agenda implies that this could potentially change in the coming years. There is risk that it could fall from one of the top spots in blockchain to one of the lowest. The President has commented that the cancellation of said projects was predominantly to save money. He scoffs at the idea of an indigenous coin, stating: We are cutting expenses. We were about to use 40 million Reales to teach natives to use bitcoin. It is possible that Bolsonaros words dont imply he doesnt know anything about bitcoin, but rather that he sarcastically doesnt consider bitcoin to be a valid investment tool or even money. If thats the case, Bolsonoaro shares the same ideology as American billionaire and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, who has never been particularly friendly towards bitcoin. In recent news, Buffett is slated to have a three-hour lunch with TRON founder Justin Sun, who is going to work hard at convincing him of the value of crypto.

Just a short way to go and the currency will be back at $8,000. Unfortunately, the currency is still trading for about $1,000 less than where it stood just one or two weeks ago, which means that while the currency has recovered somewhat, theres still plenty of room for improvement. The reason behind the drop could be a selloff that occurred early last week. One source says that selloffs like these are gaining traction. Theyre also proof that many people still do not understand what cryptocurrencies are about. While many were designed as units of payment, that route hasnt been fully established as of late. Yes, were witnessing the birth of organizations such as Flexa that are designed to make cryptocurrency payments easier for both users and merchants alike. However, this has been a long time in the making given cryptos constant volatility and vulnerability to price swings. In the meantime, people have learned to trade crypto and rely on it as an investment. With the growth of bitcoin since early April, the currency is once again spreading its wings and looking to erase some of the bad press it garnered in 2018, and for the most part, its been successful, but selloffs show that many people still arent using crypto the way that they should. For example, analyst Oliver Issacs thinks bitcoin could potentially reach $25,000 by the end of the year. These predictions may seem like theyre a dime a dozen, but when you have bulls such as Tim Draper stating figures like $250,000 within the next three to four years, the idea of saving ones coins to test out such growth should appear a little more intriguing. Selloffs like these occur because some traders are likely thinking too small. They earn a bit of profit and immediately sell. The whole strategy behind building ones investments is to sit back and allow them time to grow. Not doing this can lead to two issues, the first being a very personal one  the traders wealth cannot expand. The second is that the crypto market cannot recover the way it should. As mentioned, bitcoin and other digital assets boasted a very rough year in 2018. There were drops and falls aplenty, and many enthusiasts would like to see those losses erased before 2019 expands further. As of late, bitcoin has spiked somewhat in the past 24 hours, though much praise should also go to altcoins such as Ripples XRP, Ethereum and Litecoin. These currencies, and others like them, have experienced solid price boosts over the past day, and will likely continue to do so granted bitcoin can at least remain where it is.

In a recent statement, Deutsche Bandesbank president Jens Weidmann commented that bitcoin and other forms of crypto have the power to destabilize financial systems and worsen bank runs. While this argument has been heard before, it reflects a growing fear amongst many traditional financial institutions in the sense that bitcoin and other forms of crypto work in a completely opposite way. Banks, for example, have total control over the financials of their customers. If you need a loan or to open a line of credit, you must approach your bank and be subjected to the terms and conditions it has set in motion. If, for whatever reason you cannot adhere to those terms, your financial situation can be completely controlled and manipulated by the bank in question. This creates a serious problem in that it potentially divides the financial well-being of citizens far too much. For instance, everyone has the need to access money and credit. Without these tools, they cannot garner the services and goods they require to survive. However, their inability to work with banks could potentially get in the way. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, put financial freedom and independence back in the hands of the people they serve. There are fewer terms that the people must adhere to. If they require a service or a specific item, a cryptocurrency can potentially be used to gain access to whatever it is they need. That is what cryptocurrency was originally designed as; a method of payment. While it currently stands as an investment or nest egg for some, its original goal was to potentially replace cash and credit as a means of paying for both goods and services. Weidmann expressed the following when it came to cryptocurrency: Some argue it could be run on a distributed ledger. In such a case, it would replace or complement reserves at the central bank with a restricted-access digital token A token would be a bearer asset, meaning that during the transaction, the sender would transfer value to the receiver without intermediaries. This is something fundamentally different from the current system in which the central bank debits and credits the accounts without transferring actual values. Basically, Weidmann appears to be expressing the idea that bitcoin and digital currencies bear no value as money. This is the same argument presented by mega-financial figures such as Warren Buffett, but is it possible the argument is wrong? Justin Sun, the CEO of Tron, recently commented that while he has great respect for men of Buffetts stature, its unlikely that theyre always on the money when it comes to deciding what makes a solid investment and what doesnt.

This is refreshing considering bitcoin has ultimately dropped by more than $1,000 in the past week. Back in April, bitcoin reached a new pinnacle. 2018 had been a bad year for both bitcoin and other forms of crypto. The currency had fallen from its all-time high in December 2017 of nearly $20,000 and hadnt managed to gain any serious traction in the 12 months that followed. In fact, drops were becoming a constant with entities like bitcoin to the point that in November 2018, the currency ultimately fell by more than 80 percent and was trading at roughly $3,500 for several weeks. In April the following year, however, things took a very positive turn. After longwinded and negative ideas centering on bitcoins demise and the idea that it would never recover, the granddaddy of all digital currency ultimately grew beyond the $5,000 mark. The move was very unexpected and put the currency back on the bandwagon with many traders and enthusiasts, who felt the future held a positive outlook at last for the asset, but things didnt quite stop there. In the coming months, bitcoin continued to grow, reaching $6,000, then $7,000, then $8,000 and even briefly hitting the $9,000 mark before falling back into the $8,000 range. While $9,000 has proven to be a difficult barrier to break, the currency is trying hard, and many analysts remain bullish about bitcoin, stating that further price hikes will occur before the year is out. The recent fall that bitcoin has experienced is being labeled as a simple pullback. Enthusiasts and traders are being warned not to fall into a panic and assume that all is lost with the coin. These things happen, and bitcoin is merely taking time to settle from the recent selloff that occurred just last week. They are confident that this is simply a reverse step the coin is taking, but that further jumps will occur down the line. However, there is also a warning that most of the reported cryptocurrency trading volume (roughly 86 percent) is potentially fake. One should always take the documented results with a grain of salt. At the same time, most of the activity reported on major exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, Gemini, Bittrex and Kraken appears to be solid, while an additional ten percent of activity occurring on non-documented exchanges also contributes to the more real volume not always recorded by Bitwise-vetted exchanges. Thus, it can be safely said that trading is relatively high, and that enthusiasm for bitcoin and most other major cryptocurrencies is at a healthy level. ","['bitcoin', 'crypto', 'Trading Volume']"

It sounds like a challenging feat, but for one man, the trip became a reality through whats known as the Money 2020 Payments Race. The person who made this trip is Alex Hobern, the reality star of a controversial television program in the United Kingdom known as, The Circle. Hobern took part in the Payments Race and was part of Team Crypto, meaning he could only use digital assets to pay for things like hotel rooms, airfare, meals and other assorted travel-based items. The trip lasted 12 days and took Hobern through many different regions of the globe including the U.K., Ireland, Canada, eastern Europe and the Middle East. The trip (and the race) ended in Amsterdam. While he admits that the trip was fun, the entire situation was a huge challenge and a learning experience for him. He admits that he had virtually no cryptocurrency experience prior to taking part in the race. While he was aware of what cryptocurrency was, he had never utilized it or engaged in crypto trading prior to the event. He ultimately had to learn about cryptocurrencies as he went, utilizing sites like Coin Map to find crypto-accepting hotels and restaurants. For the most part, he says he used Ripples XRP and ether tokens to pay his way through the 12-day race. He comments: In general, the easiest parts were the hotels and flights. There were middlemen who were able to accept bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in exchange for booking these things. One of the biggest problems Hobern appears to have encountered on his journey is the extreme lack of cryptocurrency knowledge and education amongst everyday citizens. Its one thing for a company to say it accepts cryptocurrency as a means of payment, but if its not going to train its employees in what it is or how it can be used, thats going to defeat the purpose. Hobern discusses one situation in which he came across a store in Ireland that allegedly accepted bitcoin: There were a lot of stores and merchants who said online or in their window that they accepted bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, but we were unable to use it when we arrived.

It seems like something of an enigma; after all, you control the account or business in question, so you obviously know how to access it properly. Nevertheless, it appears hacking itself is exactly what one company has done. That company is known as the Komodo Platform. After learning that there was a backdoor open in its coding that could potentially give hackers access to its customers funds, the company ultimately infiltrated itself and moved its clients funds onto a different network, knowing that they would be saving their money from theft. In many ways, its a noble move to make, but not everyone is taking the news lightly. The backdoor was discovered in whats known as the Agama application, a digital wallet developed by the Komodo team. The company knew that several wallets had either already been compromised or were on the verge of being compromised. With little time to act, it moved funds as best as it could and as quickly as it could. These funds included $13 million in assorted bitcoins and Komodo tokens, and all potential hacks were ultimately thwarted. This is good news in that nobody was hurt or stolen from or humiliated. However, some customers are complaining that their funds were tampered with or tackled without their permission and are demanding a better explanation from the Komodo team. The company has since announced that the coins are on a new platform and that customers have the chance to reclaim their coins. The move was not about stealing coins or moving them out of peoples control; it was about preventing a malicious actor from taking advantage of the company and its clientele. Despite all the money it handles, Komodo is still being labeled a cryptocurrency startup, which means its still in the early stages of operating. In a statement, company executives announced why they did what they did, along with the full results of the money move: After discovering the vulnerability, our cyber security team used the same exploit to gain control of a lot of affected seeds and secure the funds at risk. We were able to sweep around eight million in KMD and 96 BTC from the vulnerable wallets, which otherwise would have been easy pickings for an attacker. The safe KMD and BTC wallets are under the control of the Komodo team, and assets can be reclaimed by their owners. See our support page article for details. Digital hacks and cyberattacks have become far too common in the crypto industry, and its nice to know that companies like Komodo are taking the necessary steps to prevent their customers from being affected. Despite its startup status, Komodo did what several larger, more established crypto-based companies couldnt. ","['bitcoin', 'cyberattack', 'Komodo']"

Bitcoin, the granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies, has recovered somewhat over the past 24 hours and has shot back up to the $8,000 range. At press time, it is currently trading for about $8,051. While it hasnt recovered fully since its recent drop to $7,600, its nice to see that volatility isnt as strong as it was a year ago. Bitcoin, for whatever reason, fell victim to harsh market circumstances that caused it to fall to $7,400 by the mid-week. The consensus was that a massive sell-off occurred after the currency had briefly hit the $9,000 mark for the first time in over a year. Many investors, particularly major bitcoin holders, decided to sell either all or part of their stashes to earn a quick buck. This completely goes against what bitcoin is all about. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are an investment. Unless youre going to use the digital asset to pay for goods and services, which is what it was originally designed for, one should always allow bitcoin and its digital cousins to grow, which is what makes these sell-offs so devastating. They are particularly hazardous to the crypto environment granted they occur at the hands of whales. These figures not only hold large amounts of crypto in their accounts, but they do not store this crypto on exchanges like a standard trader. They instead rely completely on digital wallets, and when they do transfer their funds to an exchange, things can become very wary and drops  sometimes big ones  are likely to occur. Such is the case this week, though at the time of writing, bitcoin has added a full $600 since that initial drop, and its a positive sign that bitcoin is doing all it can to remain above the $8,000 mark. However, both $8,000 and $9,000 are proving to be rough resistance levels for bitcoin. While it has already surpassed the first level, analysts are warning that the currency will need to work extra hard to pass the $9,000 line if it doesnt want to be overtaken by the bears again. There is better news in the sense that bitcoin is scheduled to undergo another halving in early 2020, which one expert says can cause a stronger price boom. From there, we could probably expect bitcoin to spike further as it did in 2017, which means it will be less vulnerable to outside (negative) market influence. For now, however, bitcoin must learn to do something with what it has. It has passed $8,000 again, and it must do all in its power to at least maintain this present position. Otherwise, it runs the risk of repeating some of 2018s less-than-stellar results. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Whales']"

After touting bitcoins strength and saying that its working its rear off to stay above $8,000, bitcoin has undergone a serious drop that saw it lose roughly $600 in 24 hours. At press time, the granddaddy of all digital assets is trading in the $7,900 range. The good news is that bitcoin had ultimately fallen to $7,700, which means that its currently trading for $200 more. Perhaps the bulls just need a break before they attempt to break $9,000 again. Still, its a little disappointing to see some solid gains and progress suddenly disappear. Mind you, its only $600  not $6,000, like what we saw in 2018, but it still gets under our skin. One source is attributing this behavior to a sudden sell-off. Heres a legit question for everyone who sold their bitcoin stashes last night: What the heck are you doing? With bitcoins recent behavior, more spikes were likely, which means that you could have potentially added more to your worth and earnings before selling everything off completely. Selloffs like these are proof that many investors simply arent thinking big enough. While hodling under all circumstances is one extreme, its not always smart to cash out so early in the game. Investors need to think long-term into the future if theyre going to rake in any considerable earnings. One Reddit user explains: About 20-30 minutes before the dump, a whale moved 25K BTC (worth $215 million) to Coinbase. About an hour after the dump, a whale moved $14K BTC (worth $112 million) from Coinbase to another wallet. Another user puts it best in a separate post: If you do a little math and follow the timeline, its not hard to see that someone dumped 25,000 bitcoins for $215 million and bought it back shortly after for $200 million. In doing so, they pocketed $15 million and walked away with the same amount of bitcoin as they started with. This mentality doesnt make sense. The whole point of investing is to assume gains and add to your overall net worth. Why utilize a strategy thats going to place you right back where you started? Despite the drop, many analysts and industry leaders arent terribly worried about what will happen next. Timothy Tam  chief executive and co-founder of cryptocurrency research firm Coin Fi in Hong Kong  claims that this is just normal bitcoin volatility, and that the drop isnt likely to last long. He comments: It just got a little bit extended. This is a healthy retracement. Theres quite a lot of volume going through. This is normal bitcoin volatility. At the end of the day, it still doesnt take a lot of money to move these markets compared with traditional markets. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'bitcoin selloff']"

For one thing, $14 billion was recently removed from the cryptocurrency market. There have been some recurring drops among smaller cryptocurrencies and altcoins, and to be fair, bitcoin has succumbed to a few of these drops as well. However, the granddaddy appears to be making a statement: that for the time being anyway, its refusing to fall below the $8,000 mark that its worked so hard to get to, and so far, its accomplishing that goal. Recently, bitcoin rose above $8,000 when people least expected it to. The rise occurred during a hacking scandal that involved popular cryptocurrency exchange service Binance, which was the victim of a malicious attack that saw more than $40 million in bitcoin funds disappear overnight. The news was hard to deal with, for both crypto enthusiasts and Binance. Many wondered if this would mark a time of bearish activity for the currency, but ultimately things turned around quickly. Bitcoin did experience a solid price change, but this time, the change was positive. Three or even two years ago, bitcoin would more than likely have dropped from the news of the hacking. This time, it rose beyond the $6,000 mark. Then came $7,000. Finally, $8,000 came along. It seems that bitcoin has garnered more maturity as of late, and its eager to prove itself once and for all to its still many prominent doubters. Thats why its so bent on remaining above $8,000. Several altcoins and major competitors have experienced solid drops in the past few days, such as Ethereum and Ripple, the second and third-largest cryptocurrencies by market cap respectively. Ethereum was trading for about $290 at one point, but ultimately fell to around $240 during the late Friday hours. At press time, it has managed to recover somewhat and is now trading for around $255 per unit, but theres still room for improvement. Ripples XRP has fallen to about 40 cents, though the bulls are now focusing on 50 cents per unit, where the coin appears to be experiencing the most resistance as of late. Bitcoin fell hard from around $8,900 to $8,300 over the past 24 hours but has since recovered somewhat and is trading at just over $8,500. The currency has stayed strong and will likely remain so in the coming weeks. Either way, the original projected goal of reaching $9,000 by the end of the week doesnt appear likely at press time, which means bitcoin has a new goal set for next week.

Previously, the nation had placed a ban on cryptocurrencies and related trading activity. It was a sad sight in many ways, as cryptocurrencies could potentially do a lot for nations similar with Egypt, but the country has had serious trust issues with digital assets given their volatility and alleged ties to money laundering and related criminal activity. Crypto was banned in Egypt in 2018, though bitcoin was later considered legal under halal, which means its permissible in Sharia Law for several Muslim nations. A report explains: The new draft law has allocated great importance to financial technology, keeping pace with major developments in the banking industry in the world and enhancing the use of modern technology in the provision of financial and banking services The new law provides legal authority for the electronic authentication of bank transactions, electronic payment orders, and transfer orders as well as for the electronic settlement of checks and the issuance and circulation of electronic checks and electronic discount orders, provided the Board of Directors of CBE issue rules and procedures regulating all the aforementioned actions. The ban remained in place up until this week. While cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses will be allowed to operate in Egypt, they can only do so if they garner the appropriate licenses before beginning their operations. Thus, they can engage in business relations and financial transactions, but the process is likely to be somewhat difficult in the long run. Several nations like Egypt stand to benefit from cryptocurrencies. When standard credit options or traditional financial means arent always available, cryptocurrencies have a lot to offer. Fears of volatility, while still somewhat warranted, should probably begin to cease considering that assets like bitcoin have shown a certain strength thats never been witnessed before. For example, popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance was the victim of a hack in recent weeks, with more than $40 million in bitcoin units stolen from the platform. Three or four years ago, bitcoin would have undoubtedly experienced a solid drop thanks to this news. This time, however, things proved to be quite different. Bitcoins price did change, but it changed for the better. News of the hack didnt get in the way of bitcoin spiking beyond $6,000, then $7,000 and ultimately $8,000 in recent days. What bitcoin remains open to, unfortunately, is security issues that make it vulnerable to malicious activity similar with what was seen with Binance, though to be fair, these security issues arent really the product of bitcoin but rather the platforms that store it. Binance stored these bitcoin units in hot wallets, which is a mistake given its lack of security compared to cold storage tactics. ","['Binance', 'bitcoin', 'crypto', 'Egypt']"

Bitcoin has always been the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies, which is why reaching nearly $20,000 in December of 2017 was a moment to be cherished by most enthusiasts and traders everywhere. When it began to sink into oblivion in 2018, many were upset not just about their own financial losses, but by the idea that cryptocurrency was some sort of a hoax  an illegitimate scam that was easily manipulated and hard to control. Since April of this year, bitcoin has shown new promise by growing in price and increasing its position on the financial ladder. However, it has also shown a great level of maturity never witnessed before with any other cryptocurrency in the space. When Binance was hacked and ultimately lost more than $40 million in BTC funds, many were surprised (and excited) that instead of falling back several steps, bitcoin rose beyond the $6,000 mark, then the $7,000 mark and finally the $8,000 mark. About three years ago, if that hack had occurred, bitcoin would have likely taken a huge stumble and would be rolling around in the gutter right about now. This time, however, bitcoin showed great strength and an ability to withstand outside market manipulation. Its price still changed, but it changed for the better, and this got everyones hopes up. Unfortunately, not everybody feels the same way. Among those who still doubt bitcoins prowess is the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM), which recently issued a warning to clients saying that bitcoin is not legal tender and that it shouldnt be used in the place of fiat currency. The banks governor offered a statement saying that cryptocurrencies are not recognized by the institution, and that customers should avoid using them: The Reserve Bank of Malawi wishes to advise the public that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Malawi. The RBM is, however, aware that they are used as a means of payment or medium exchange, a store of value or invested assets online. In addition, the statement also reads that the bank holds no sway over cryptocurrencies. It does not control them, and it does not regulate them. Thus, customers should be wary in the sense that if their stashes are ever stolen, the bank will not step in to replace the funds or investigate the thieving party. This is simply a classic case of banks vs. crypto. Several traditional institutions, it can be argued, are afraid of the decentralization that crypto can bring to the financial arena, and fear losing control over customers finances.

The currency continues to impress us all with its recent string of price gains, which began in early April of 2019. At that time, the currency rose beyond the $5,000 mark, something many traders and enthusiasts thought theyd never see again. That means that at press time, it has nearly tripled its value in just two months from where it was in March. 2019 has certainly proven to be a solid year for the digital asset. Following consistent price drops in 2018 that saw the currency hitting the $3,500 mark in late November, bitcoin had ultimately lost more than 70 percent of its value since striking its all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December of 2017. Many crypto traders saw all their stashes disappear within 11 months; it was an ugly sight, and one that many believed would never be remedied. However, things have ultimately turned around in 2019, with the currency striking a position that it hasnt held in more than a year. The last time bitcoin even came close to $9,000 was during the summer months of 2018, and the last time it saw the $9,000 range was in February of that year. Despite all the good news, however, some analysts seem incapable of making up their minds regarding where bitcoin is likely to go in the coming weeks. One crypto blogger, Kevin Godbold, thinks a dead cat bounce is inevitable, and suggests that bitcoin could potentially take a nosedive sooner than we might anticipate. He comments: The buying probably caused the share price to move up. A little at first, but seeing the movement, others maybe started saying, Bitcoins moving, and more buying happened. Because of that, bitcoin went higher, and the higher it went, the more the momentum speculators piled in. The more they piled in, the higher bitcoin moved. I think that description is the essence of what causes a dead cat bounce. Nothing has changed in the case for or against bitcoin, but speculation happened. At the same time, another source claims that the bitcoin technical charts currently show the digital asset preparing itself to reach $10,000 in the coming weeks, virtually the opposite of what Godbold suggests. A recent panel of cryptocurrency experts  assembled by the finance firm Finder  predict that by December 2019, bitcoin will be trading for well over $9,600. This is good in the sense that bitcoin will spike further, but its a little disappointing that fewer rises will seemingly take place over the following seven months. At the same time, the panel also believes that the $20,000 mark hit in December 2017 will be surpassed at some point in the future. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'cryptocurrency']"

Japan has had a very up-and-down relationship with cryptocurrencies. On the one hand, the country is home to some of the most legitimate cryptocurrency regulation known to the space. It has been involved in cryptocurrencies for many years and trades digital assets almost as much as it does its national fiat, the yen. On the other hand, getting to this point has been rather rough. The country is home to the two largest cryptocurrency hacks to ever take place, Mt. Gox and Coincheck. Mt. Gox occurred in February 2014 when more than $400 million in bitcoins  the record holder for most money stolen in a crypto hack at the time  went up in smoke practically overnight. This record stood for nearly four years until Coincheck occurred. This time, the loss exceeded half-a-billion dollars in assorted crypto funds, and the stats made Mt. Gox look like small beans by comparison. As a result, the countrys Financial Services Agency (FSA) had to get involved. They began monitoring cryptocurrency exchanges for any lagging security protocols and began sending threatening letters to platforms that did not measure up in some way. The time had come to either shape up or ship out; any exchanges that did not adhere to present safety rules would likely face the prospects of being shut down permanently. To be fair, the FSA has done its job in getting the countrys crypto industry up to par, and things are running smoothly as of late. Exchanges like Mt. Gox and Coincheck have been working to repay all the losses, though the process has been relatively slow. The new exchange, known as TaoTao, is set to begin operations on May 30. For now, only trading in ether tokens and bitcoins will be available, though the company has mentioned that both bitcoin cash and Litecoin trading will be added in the coming weeks. Originally, TaoTao was set to make its official debut in mid-May, though this was ultimately pushed back for reasons not yet understood. Japan is home to several new bitcoin and cryptocurrency traders following the recent surge in crypto prices beginning in early April. At press time, for example, bitcoin is trading for over $8,800, and is expected to reach $9,000 by the end of the week at the latest. Its a glorious sight to see; the granddaddy of all crypto is well on its way to hitting a price mark it hasnt hit in over a year. What will investors think, and can we expect to see further rallies as more trading becomes prominent? Currently, the FSA is reviewing TaoTaos anti-money laundering tactics to ensure they are strong enough to prevent illicit activity. ","['crypto', 'Japan', 'TaoTao']"

At press time, the daddy of all digital assets is trading for just over $8,000. This is great news considering there have been a few drops over the past few weeks, and many still havent fully recovered from the massive losses incurred in 2018. Recently, the currency fell to the mid-$7,000 range. While this wasnt a huge problem, many began showing concern that the bears were taking over the financial reins yet again. Its not easy to get over losses of more than $10,000 that quickly. Either way, bitcoin showed an incredible level of maturity by sticking to its guns and maintaining a certain level of momentum that it hasnt shown in the past. Never was this more evident than when Binance, the popular cryptocurrency exchange, was the victim of a $40 million hack that saw more than 7,000 BTC units disappear overnight. In the past, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would have likely fallen victim to negative hype and experienced solid price drops. This time, however, things were very different. Bitcoin jumped by more than $1,000 in a week, claiming a spot on the financial ladder it hadnt held in some time. Enthusiasts got a taste of what bitcoin would be like if it was a mature asset, not simply a developing coin that was trying desperately to make a name for itself. The move has prompted many bulls to make their thoughts and feelings known. One of those bulls is broadcaster Max Keiser, who recently commented that bitcoin was likely to hit $100,000 in a very short time. Hes advising everyone who possesses bitcoin to hold onto it, as theyre about to reap rewards they never anticipated. He states: The timing is immaterial. It is still going to outperform every other asset you can possibly imagine owning over the next five, ten or 15 years. Forget about timing. Timing is for people who think, Im going to wait and buy it at a better price. That is a bad way to approach crypto. Stack Satoshis! While his prediction is about $150,000 less than whats been predicted by noted venture capitalist Tim Draper, its still an ambitious hypothesis, and many are hoping his beliefs will come to fruition. Furthermore, many bitcoin bulls are now praising the big bitcoin halving thats set to occur sometime in 2020. The process will involve reducing the amount of rewards offered to miners that extract or mine new cryptocurrencies, in this case, bitcoin. Many bulls believe this will lead to stronger prices for the digital asset. Events like these have occurred in both 2012 and 2016 and resulted in rallies for the coin. Bulls are confident 2020 will produce similar results. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'Halving', 'Max Keiser']"

Dorsey is now looking to incorporate bitcoin and additional cryptocurrencies into his secondary business, digital payment platform Square. He says that the staff of Square plans to improve money through additional bitcoin and crypto-based development, and the companys new blockchain division known as Square Crypto is all set to make its first hire. Many analysts are now weighing in with hopes that this will lead to a fresh new wave of bitcoin innovation and adoption. The cryptocurrency division of Square released the following message on Twitter: We are close to making our first hire. So, lets set some expectations. True to @jacks founding tweets, we are building open-source projects that will make mass adoption not just possible, but inevitable. Last March, Dorsey and his staff mentioned that they would be adding about three or four bitcoin and crypto engineers to work on open-source contributions full-time, along with a new developer. They also mentioned that theyd be willing to pay the employees in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies if they so desired. No stranger to bitcoin and digital assets, Dorsey has often offered praise towards the daddy of all crypto, claiming that it would be the worlds single currency in approximately ten years. Thats an ambitious idea  everyone in the world using only bitcoin in less than a decade? Seems hard, but somehow doable. In an interview with CNBC, he states: The world will have a single currency. The internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be bitcoin Its slow and costly, but as more and more people have it and buy it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off blockchain and make it more approachable. Dorsey, of course, addresses two big problems that the currency has been facing as of late. For one thing, the transaction fees associated with bitcoin can often exceed the fees one will witness with other forms of crypto. This makes it a more expensive currency to use. In addition, its blockchain speeds do not match those of Ethereum, EOS or other networks, which can often complete transactions in anywhere between a few minutes to a few seconds. Bitcoin, on the other hand, may require as much as 24 hours to fully complete a transaction. Last February, the social media mogul was asked by a user on Twitter which cryptocurrencies he invested in. Dorsey responded that he only had bitcoin. When asked why, he issued more praise for the asset, claiming: Bitcoin is resilient. Bitcoin is principled. Bitcoin is native to internet ideals, and its a great brand.

BTC is likely to climb higher in the near term as long as the $7,640 support area. This week, bitcoin price gained a strong bullish momentum above the $7,500 barrier against the US Dollar. The upward move was strong, as the price settled above the $7,800 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). The BTC/USD pair climbed above the $8,000 and $8,200 resistance levels. It once again tested the $8,350 resistance area, where sellers emerged. A swing high was formed near $8,320 and recently the price started a downside correction. There was a break below the $8,000 support and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $6,631 low to $8,320 high. Moreover, there was a spike below the $7,800 level and the price tested the $7,600 support area. The 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $6,631 low to $8,320 high also acted as a strong support. More importantly, the 55 simple moving average (4-hours) also acted as a support above $7,600. At the moment, the price is attempting a close below a crucial contracting triangle with support near $7,920 on the 4-hours chart. If there is a proper close below the $7,900 support, there are chances of more losses. An immediate support is at $7,840 and the 55 SMA. Any further losses are likely to push the price towards the main $7,640 and $7,600 support levels. On the upside, the triangle resistance is near the $8,000 level, above which there are chances of more gains. The next key resistance is near the $8,180. Having said that, the bulls need to clear the $8,350 barrier for a fresh rally towards the $8,500 and $8,800 levels.

Its strange in the sense that JPMorgan has clearly initiated a run in the crypto market with the development of its new JPM Coin. At the same time, the banking giant cant seem to find common ground with the industrys big daddy bitcoin. In a recent statement, the financial enterprise issued a warning to all customers investing in bitcoin and related forms of crypto that the behavior being witnessed by most major coins mirrors the boom-bust trend that was originally witnessed between 2017 and 2018. As we all remember, 2017 was marked by consistent (and grand) price spikes for bitcoin and other forms of mainstream crypto, with bitcoin reaching its all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December of 2017. Sadly, 2018 did not bring the same level of joy and comfort, but rather delivered huge losses to most crypto traders. By January of that year, bitcoin had dropped to $16,000. It later fell to $12,000, then $11,000, and finished out late February at a mere $9,000, ultimately losing more than half of its previous December value. By November 2018, however, bitcoin fell to $3,500 following a controversial bitcoin cash hard fork that pitted many industry leaders against each other. Several months went by of virtually no activity, and many thought bitcoins were doomed for good. In April of this year, however, bitcoin began experiencing several price spikes. It ultimately rose beyond the $5,000 mark, and at press time, is trading for about $7,800. It has more than doubled its price over the past six months, marking a huge turning point to the once dismally-performing cryptocurrency, but it appears not everyone is happy. In its statement, JPMorgan explains: Over the past few days, the actual price has moved sharply over marginal cost. This divergence between actual and intrinsic values carries some echoes of the spike higher in late 2017, and at the time, this divergence was resolved mostly by a reduction in actual prices Defining an intrinsic or fair value for any cryptocurrency is clearly challenging. Indeed, views range from some researchers arguing that it has no fundamental value, to others estimating fair values exceeding current prices. It can be suggested that JPMorgans fear is premature. Were not even at the halfway point of 2019, and already theres concern that 2017 is repeating itself. Second, the price spikes bitcoin has incurred this year are occurring at a much steadier pace than they were in 2017, which was likely the product of market manipulation. While spikes are occurring regularly, they are shorter and cover less ground than they did in 2017, so to assume that 2017 is happening all over again probably isnt entirely accurate.

Yes, but we should reword that question so that it makes a little more sense. Its not so much that cryptocurrency changes, but rather the technology behind it, and in the case of mainstream cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, big changes are occurring. Some of these changes are very noticeable. For example, the currency recently managed to spike beyond the $8,000 mark despite a nasty Binance hack that saw more than $40 million in BTC funds practically disappear overnight. Live Bitcoin News reported on this situation a few weeks ago, and only recently did the exchange come back online and resume all trading services. It was a sad sight to see, but there was some good news to emerge from the situation. For one thing, bitcoin would have radically been altered in the past thanks to a hack that large. Such a theft would have caused the price to drop drastically; it would have fallen, and investors would be out of money. Well, this time was no different. The price changed drastically as usual, but the change flew to the north rather than the south. This time around, bitcoin ultimately gained in price, and was trading at a higher mark than it has in nearly a year. This suggests a big (and bold) change for bitcoin. Perhaps the currency is developing a thicker skin as of late. In other words, it can be argued that the currency is growing more mature, and less susceptible to outside market influence. Thus, its going to take a lot more than a common occurrence like a hack to bring bitcoin down to a low mark again. This little factoid was recently confirmed by data provider Indexica, which stated in a recent report that there has been a coming of age for bitcoin. At only ten years old, bitcoin is showing signs of strength that most forms of fiat dont exhibit, proving that the coin is truly on course to becoming a strong and capable global currency. In addition, bitcoin is being examined in the same light as a companys stock. Its now seen as a valid and legitimate investment, with many direct traders or investors regularly looking into the future to see where the cryptocurrency will go next and what developments will be made. Such individuals are no longer simply concerned with price; they want to know how bitcoin can potentially affect the financial market. Zak Selbert  chief executive officer of Indexica  comments: Think about it. Executives will speak of good things they expect to happen on conference calls before they happen. They only mention mistakes afterwards. This suggests that bitcoin is not only more popular but is heading closer and closer towards mainstream territory.

The exchange is now one of many that have fallen victim to malicious activity. Others, such as Mt. Gox in 2014 and Coincheck in 2018, boast much bigger losses, so things could have been a lot worse for one of the worlds largest crypto exchanges. Nevertheless, executives say that while they have the reserves to replace what was lost, the action still hurts. The hack occurred on the morning of May 7. The funds were stolen from a hot wallet that was connected to the internet. Immediately following the hack, Binance released a statement to all its customers explaining what had happened and that they had halted all withdrawals, trades and deposits on its platform when it noticed unusual activity occurring. CEO Changpeng Zhao also took to Twitter regularly to ensure all customers knew what was going on and what was being done to thwart future theft attempts. A variety of methods were used to steal the money, including viruses and phishing. A statement released by the company reads: The hackers had the patience to wait and execute well-orchestrated actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time. The transaction is structured in a way that passed our existing security checks. Once executed, the withdrawal triggered various alarms in our system. We stopped all withdrawals immediately after that. To get more of its customers to return, Binance is engaging in a heavy marketing campaign designed to boost bitcoin adoption and related services. Customers have an opportunity to be upgraded to VIP levels and potentially earn part of a 50,000 pool of Binance Coin units. As many enthusiasts and traders know, Binance is an exchange that boasts its own currency thats also a stable coin. A pool of 50,000 would be equal to roughly $1.36 million in USD. To qualify for a portion of the money, customers must have traded at least one bitcoin (or the equivalent of one bitcoin in other cryptocurrencies) between now and May 18. At press time, it is unclear who is responsible for the hack. The company has stated that it will improve current security protocols by implementing know-your-customer (KYC) tactics. Binance also released commentary regarding how users can better protect their accounts and prevent fraudulent activity. The company explains: From now until the commencement of trading, users will be able to cancel open orders, process deposits and use other account-related functions To increase the security and protection of your account, we recommend that you read through 14 Tips to Enhance Security for Your Binance Account, as well as periodically change your password, reset your 2FA, and update your anti-phishing code.

The currency, which had recently pushed beyond the $8,000 mark, is now trading for just over $7,100. This marks a near-$1,000 fall over the last 24 hours, though the good news is that bitcoin had previously fallen to about $6,400, and the range where its at now is a definite improvement. It seems like no matter how well bitcoin does, it still manages to make investors nervous. Nobody can relax, and the idea that price swings can occur at any time rings through their brains. The other unfortunate thing is that bitcoins behavior tends to take a serious toll on other forms of crypto. Ethereum, for example, also fell by over seven percent within the last 24 hours, while Ripples XRP dropped by more than 15 percent. Jehan Chu  co-founder of Kenetic Capital  states his thoughts on the bearish turn crypto has taken: This last drop was likely caused by a combination of profit-taking and algorithmic trading compounding the swift fall. We can expect these types of steep rises and drops to continue for some time until institutional investors grow market volume. Ah, the age-old argument behind institutional investors. No doubt theyve gotten involved in crypto over the last two years, but maybe they just havent gotten involved fast enough. With the introduction of cryptocurrency trading amongst investing platforms like Fidelity and E-Trade, we can likely expect more institutional activity in the coming months, but for now, their lagging presence is taking a toll on prices. Chu further commented that: The key takeaway from the past few weeks is that with each of these surges, the overall interest and investment continues to expand around a growing core of real blockchain use and adoption. For the most part, bitcoin has been struggling for nearly a year-and-a-half to move back up towards its all-time high of roughly $20,000 in December 2017. While the currency has managed to incur a few spikes since the beginning of April, theres still plenty of room for improvement. At press time, theres still a near-$13,000 window remaining if bitcoin is to get back to its former glory days. 2018 was marred by so many serious drops that its likely to take bitcoin some time to return to its December 2017 status, and doing that without manipulation behind it could be even more difficult. One of the potential reasons for the sudden drop may have been a near-$7,000 bitcoin sell order on Bitstamp. Su Zhu  CEO at Three Arrows Capital  explains: BitMEX wicked down to $6,400. 2,000 BTC+ sell wall on Bitstamp absorbed. Looks like a mark price exploit by placing a large sell stamp (one of two oracles for mark on BitMEX) to trigger liquidations on BitMEX. ","['bitcoin', 'bitcoin price', 'bitstamp']"

Bitcoin has been working tirelessly since early 2018. The currency fell from its all-time high of nearly $20,000 in January of last year and has since witnessed roughly 15 months of either little or no gains. Though there have been a few spurts here and there, bitcoin has mostly remained in the red, officially dropping down to $3,500 in November following a controversial bitcoin cash hard fork. However, in April of 2019, the currency began swelling like it did in 2017. Nobody really seems to know why, but many standard, everyday traders dont seem to care. They figure so long as bitcoin continues to rise, theyre in for a solid moneymaking game. The currency rose to $5,000 during the first week of last April, but has since shot up by an additional $3,000, and is now trading in the $8,000 range. Its certainly good news, but there are many reasons behind the currencys sudden hike that analysts are considering. For one thing, we have witnessed increased adoption over the past several months. With the introduction of platforms like Bakkt and Flexa for example, many retailers are now being given an opportunity to accept crypto as a form of payment. This is pushing cryptos mainstream status, as well as its usage. Mati Greenspan, a senior analyst at the cryptocurrency exchange e-Toro, comments: There are literally dozens of reasons for bitcoin to be surging right now, but the important thing to remember is the main driver of this rally is increased adoption. The situation is almost funny, in a way. Despite its constant price drops in 2018, bitcoin has maintained a steady level of popularity, and usage hasnt seemed to fall. People and businesses have continued to back bitcoin without regard to its previous drooping phase. Other possible reasons include increased activity amongst institutional traders, who have seemingly shown greater interest in crypto. Record cash flows have been recorded in the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which allows many investors to hold bitcoin indirectly. In addition, bitcoin is being looked at as a way of saving up against the current trade war between the United States and China. There have also been several crypto conventions in the Big Apple, as of late. New York, at one point, was a state that was notoriously anti-crypto. Jeremy Allaire  the co-founder and CEO of Circle  recently stated in an interview: Crypto fundamentals have been strong and building since early this year, when it was clear that we were oversold, and the continued parade of positive news and new retail and institutional offerings launching are firmly behind this bull market move.

The BTC/USD pair climbed above the $7,500 and $8,000 resistance levels to trade to a new 10-month high. It even traded above $8,300 and formed a high at $8,345. Recently, it started a downside correction below the $8,100 level. The price traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $6,865 low to $8,345 high. However, the $7,600 support zone acted as a strong barrier for sellers. It represents the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $6,865 low to $8,345 high. Besides, there is a crucial bullish trend line forming with support at $7,620 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is currently moving higher towards the $8,080 and $8,120 resistance levels. The main hurdle is near $8,200, above which the price is likely to retest the $8,345 high.

Bitcoin continues to impress us all. After just a few short days, bitcoin has shot past the $8,000 mark, giving us its highest prices in nearly a year. The currency had already impressed most traders with its run to $7,000 over the weekend. This was unexpected, considering many analysts believed the currency would likely remain in the $5,000 range, where it had been trading for the past several weeks. The currency has been on a roll since early April of this year, reaching $5,000, then $6,000, followed by $7,000 and now $8,000 over the past 24 hours. But we must consider that theres still plenty of room to move if bitcoin is every going to reach its all-time high again. Bitcoin was trading for just shy of $20,000 in December of 2017. During that time, many enthusiasts thought the currency couldnt be stopped, and that bullish behavior was likely to dominate bitcoins path for many years to come. Unfortunately, things fell apart almost as quickly as they were put together. The currency fell to $16,000 the following month after the Coincheck hack in Japan. Coincheck marked the largest cryptocurrency exchange hack in the history of the space. From there, it fell to $12,000 and then $11,000 the following month, ultimately finishing out February at an even $9,000. By the summer, bitcoin was trading in the $6,000 range. The currency remained here until Thanksgiving of last year, when it fell to the mid-$3,000 range following a controversial bitcoin cash hard fork that pitted many industry leaders against each other. It was an ugly sight, and many had cause to believe that bitcoin would never recover, but recover it has. In many ways, were in a prime position considering bitcoin is now trading near where it fell in March of 2018. In that sense, bitcoin has recovered greatly, but were still nowhere near the $20,000 mark, which means theres plenty of room for crypto to play. In addition, we must remain cautious and open-minded. As we all remember, 2017 was marked with heavy spikes in prices for bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was shooting up on a weekly basis, much like how were seeing now. The following year, it incurred several drops at once, likely because it simply rose too fast. While its too early to tell, one cant help but be a bit concerned that the results of bitcoins latest behavior are another sign of market manipulation, which is alleged to have caused the massive jumps and subsequent drops of both 2017 and 2018 respectively. For now, however, bitcoin is doing quite well, so maybe we can all just sit back for a while and relish in the sights of everybodys favorite cryptocurrency rising through the ranks once again.

Recently, news was published explaining that the father of crypto had reached the $7,000 mark. The currency has been on a serious bull run since we first entered April, and the currency has now reached a nine-month high. The big question is, Will it continue to rise beyond our expectations, or will it suddenly drop and deplete all its recent gains? Votes are in from assorted experts, and as one would anticipate, the reactions to bitcoins price are rather mixed. Some say it has entered newfound bullish territory and will rise beyond anything we could have predicted. Others spew the same old gloom and doom. Morgan Creek Digital CEO Mark Yusko is one of those people predicting good things for the asset. In a recent interview, Yusko commented that bitcoin could potentially reach $400,000 within the next ten years and could possess the same market cap as gold. He states: Gold has been hard money for 5,000 years. Its about 7.4 trillion dollars in value. The best thing about bitcoin is its digital gold. Its much easier to transport; its much easier to divide. It has all these essential qualities that I think are superior to gold. If we get the amount of value equal to gold, that would be about 7.4 trillion. Divide that by 21 million coins, and we get around $400,000 per coin, maybe $500,000 per coin. When does that happen? It might be a decade or more. Another bitcoin bull, Tim Draper, has consistently provided insight as to why he thinks bitcoin could reach a price of $250,000 by the year 2022 (just three short years from now). Doubling down on that prediction, he recently stated: I have no interest in selling my bitcoin. What would I sell it into, anyway? Moving from crypto to fiat is like trading shells for gold. It is reverting to the past. Im thinking long term Ill use it, spend it, invest it or just keep it. Pricewise, well continue to see bitcoin move higher. Ive revised my estimate up to $250,000 four years out, so well see bitcoin trade around the $250,000 mark in 2022. Nouriel Roubini, on the other hand, is on the opposite end of the spectrum. A notoriously bearish economist at New York University, he referred to bitcoin as a sh*t coin at a recent conference and said that all who traded bitcoin or other assorted cryptocurrencies were suckers. He comments: I dont care about the price of bitcoin There are 500,000 items on Google if you search sh*t coins Its a technical term. In a funny twist, hedge fund manager and bitcoin fan Mike Novogratz recently offered to wear a T-shirt saying Nouriel was right if bitcoin fell below the $6,000 mark.

The price of bitcoin recently rose to $7,000 on Sunday morning in the United States, marking a new nine-month high for everybodys favorite cryptocurrency. The coin has been pushing its price further and further since early April, and thus far, it has kept up its present momentum. Bitcoin reached (as we all remember) $20,000 per unit in December of 2017. It was a great gift, right on time for that years holiday season following nearly 24 straight months of bullish activity and steady price rises. Many enthusiasts and traders thought that bearish activity would inherently become a thing of the past, and that bitcoin would continue to rise further up the technical charts. Unfortunately, this wasnt quite the case. By January 2018, the currency had dropped by $4,000 into the $16,000 range. Many largely blamed this fall on the Coincheck hack that had occurred earlier in the month. Coincheck marked the largest hack of a cryptocurrency exchange in the industrys history, beating out the record originally held by Mt. Gox. More than half-a-billion in assorted crypto funds were stolen overnight, and Coincheck was widely reprimanded for its use of hot wallet storage tactics. In a day and age where crypto theft was practically a regular gig, one couldnt understand why such a large exchange wouldnt resort to cold storage to keep funds safe and secure. The event caused Japans Financial Services Agency (FSA) to get involved in the space. The organization began monitoring Coinchecks operations to make sure that it could increase its safety measures for customers. It did the same thing for several other exchanges within Japan and began sending warning letters to all those who didnt meet the agencys standards. The time had come to either shape up or ship out. It later seemed like Coincheck had little to do with bitcoins fall considering the coin continued to drop heavily. It later fell to $12,000 then $11,000, and it was at $9,000 by the end of February. By the time summer had rolled around, bitcoin was trading in the $6,000 range. It stayed here until November 2018, when the bitcoin cash hard fork took place. The fork proved very controversial and brought the currency down into the $3,500 range. It stayed here until just over a month ago, and its been on a steady rise ever since. Aside from the price jumps, were also witnessing great maturity with bitcoin considering it has managed to sustain its momentum despite a recent hack that saw millions of dollars in bitcoin stolen from popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. A few years ago, an event like this would have caused bitcoins price to fall further. This time, bitcoin pushed beyond the negative waves and retained its position.

The past several months has been a very scary time for many cryptocurrency lovers. Since January 2018, the currency  and many others like it  has been falling deeper into oblivion since hitting the near $20,000-mark in December of 2017. Since then, its price began to shrink faster than anyone could have anticipated, but nobody expected bitcoin to fall the way it did in November 2018. During that time, its baby brother bitcoin cash was undergoing a massive hard fork that proved very controversial. Industry leaders were ultimately pitted against one another, and many cryptocurrencies experienced significant drops in their prices. Bitcoin was one of those cryptocurrencies. Spending much of the summer and fall months hovering at around the $6,000-mark, the currency later fell to about $3,500, and remained there for nearly five months until last April, when it suddenly shot up beyond $5,000 unexpectedly. Since then, the currency has been undergoing massively bullish behavior and has been on the rise over the past four weeks, now adding an additional $1,000 to its overall price. Its a glorious sight to see, and while the currency remains far from the $20,000 position it once held, its still a huge step forward in the right direction. Former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz comments: The reality is that theres a tremendous amount of stuff going on. In some ways, theres been a small miracle. The debate is over. Bitcoin won. It is now seen by people all around the world as a legitimate place to store their value. Novogratz believes that a sudden burst in trader interest may have pushed the currency beyond $6,000. Whats quite spectacular is that bitcoin has managed to incur gains following some rather negative news. Recently, Live Bitcoin News reported that approximately 7,000 units of bitcoin  worth more than $40 million in USD  were stolen from the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. A few years ago, something like this would most likely have caused the currency to fall in price by a drastic margin. This time around, however, bitcoin hasnt fallen  it has gained. This shows that bitcoin is not only developing a thicker skin against outside market influence, but it is also maturing and entering far more legitimate territory. The asset would have fallen victim to a hack of this nature, but it has stood its ground and added to its price in the process. John Todaro  director of digital currency research for Trade Block  comments: $6K has been a key price level for bitcoin Just yesterday, we saw bitcoin prices rebound quite quickly after it was revealed that $40 million in bitcoin was stolen from wallets belonging to Binance in an exchange attack.

The news comes at a time when bitcoin seems to be enjoying new bullish trends. Since early April, the currency has been expanding in price and is currently trading for over $5,200. This is a massive difference from where bitcoin had fallen last November. For roughly five months, the cryptocurrency was trading between the mid and high $3,000 ranges, and many enthusiasts were seemingly giving up hope that anything would change quickly. Thankfully, that change occurred in less than half-a-year, though there are still plenty of improvements to be made. Bitcoin, as we all remember, was trading for about $20,000 a little over a year ago, and it could take time for the currency to reach that point again. For now, however, many investors are taking in the new sights of bitcoins latest price explosion and enjoying the larger trading window. A dark cloud has appeared, however, in the form of Chinas potential attempts to ban bitcoin mining. Yesterday, Live Bitcoin News reported on the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and its latest document of all things it will consider banning in the coming years thanks to the alleged risks they pose to the environment. Bitcoin mining sat on that list, and many are wondering if this could potentially have a negative effect on bitcoins bullish behavior. The good news is that many analysts are predicting the opposite of what average traders might think. At first glance, it seems like a ban on cryptocurrency mining would potentially lower the price of bitcoin, but experts say its likely to have the opposite effect. Mati Greenspan  a senior analyst at cryptocurrency exchange e-Toro  says: Its more likely to push bitcoin prices up than down. The loss of cheap Chinese electricity would raise the mining cost, which is net positive on price. China is suggesting the ban out of its belief that bitcoin mining has significantly wasted resources. It says that computer networks dedicated to mining operations spend hours upon hours crunching blockchain numbers. This crunching serves little to no purpose and uses vast amounts of energy and paper. The only reason it allegedly occurs is because people believe the process has value, though the NDRC claims otherwise. The move could potentially bring massive changes to one of Chinas largest enterprises. More than half of the crypto arenas newest coins are mined in China, and its difficult to say where mining companies would go. Just last year, bitcoin recorded its 300 millionth transaction. The currency remains popular despite its consistent price changes, which means a bitcoin mining ban likely wouldnt deter additional popularity. ","['bitcoin', 'Bitcoin Mining', 'bitcoin price']"

China and bitcoin have not always boasted strong relationships with each other. Last year, the country placed a ban on cryptocurrency trading and sought to limit exchange activity, but a ban on bitcoin mining would ultimately cancel out some of Chinas biggest businesses. Large bitcoin mining companies such as Bitmain have done business in China for years, and with such a ban in force, its hard to say where they would go or what they would do. Bitcoin, as of late, has been on something of a bullish roll. The currency recently spiked beyond the $5,000 mark for the first time in several months. Last November, the currency  which had been ailing since the beginning of 2018  fell into the mid-$3,000 range, causing many enthusiasts to lose their cool. Many believed the currency would either never recover or would need a lot of time to do so. The good news is that this isnt the case, and even if bitcoin stays where it is for a while, the gains are in the books and traders are enjoying the largest window theyve had in roughly five months. However, should China go through with its ban on mining, that could take a nasty toll on the currencys price. It seems that every few years, an agency known as Chinas National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) publishes a list of varying industries that it either wants to limit, discourage or restrict altogether because they are considered unsafe, illegal or bad for the environment. This latest list includes bitcoin mining as a potential option to phase out. China virtually dominates the bitcoin mining scene, which suggests that the countrys economy could suffer heavily should it take such action against mining. However, not everyone is convinced the ban will go through. Venture capitalist Dovey Wan is skeptical that China would ever go through with banning cryptocurrency mining, explaining on Twitter: NDRC updates a new version of such proposals every other 3-5 years since early 2000. Items that should be eliminated by the end of 2006 are still in the 2011 and 2019 versions. Another skeptic comes in the form of investor Jehan Chu, who explained in a statement: The NDRCs move is in line overall with Chinas desire to control different layers of the rapidly growing crypto industry. I believe China simply wants to reboot the crypto industry into one that they have oversight on, the same approach they took with the internet. There is additional speculation that China has no intention of setting the ban in stone, and that this is all simply an attempt to place crypto and blockchain applications in state control.

Both the stock exchange and Block Station have been in cahoots since the start of 2019 when they announced a plan to launch a live digital currency trading terminal. In addition, the stock exchange will also list security tokens, though at press time, these tokens have not been announced. Marlene Street Forrest  managing director of the JSE  commented: Block Station has been a good partner over the past year, working closely with us and our stakeholders to ensure that their platform satisfies every requirement. This is an unprecedented opportunity for the JSE to diversity its product offerings and attract new listings and inbound investments. We welcome retail investors and companies both locally and around the globe to trade digital assets under a safe, efficient and transparent regulatory framework. Recently, the Jamaican stock exchange was listed as one of the worlds strongest stock markets. The platforms stocks have spike by over 300 percent in just the last five years alone. Block Station co-founder Jai Waterman also had a few things to say about the partnership, explaining: We are incredibly excited to reach this milestone in our partnership with the JSE, bringing digital assets including cryptocurrency and security tokens to mainstream investors. Digital assets are the future of capital markets, and our turn-key solution paves the way for traditional financial institutions to easily adopt this new, game-changing asset class. We look forward to being part of the evolution of finance going forward. Jamaicas attitude reflects a general change in how the world and traditional financial markets are viewing cryptocurrencies. One could easily argue that they are becoming more mainstream, especially since the Jamaica Stock Exchange isnt the only one in line to list digital assets. Nasdaq is rumored to be releasing its new coin exchange by the second quarter of 2019. An anonymous spokesperson working with the company has commented that present conversations largely center around how digital currencies will be classified from a regulatory standpoint. Nasdaq is connected to organizations such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which means its likely to be hit with plenty of regulatory schemes in the coming months granted it takes the crypto route. Nevertheless, Nasdaq is expected to receive education from both groups, and plans appear to be underway. The spokesperson commented: Doing the math here, look for regulatory bodies to provide guidance in Q1 of 2019, and an announcement and a coin exchange to either be announced or launched in Q2 of 2019.

At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $3,871 according to data from CoinMarketCap. Its also important to note that the cryptocurrency has entered its longest downturn period since its inception. It does seem, however, that the tides might be turning. Over-the-counter trading on popular Bitcoin peer-to-peer trading platform LocalBitcoin is seeing massive increases. Just a week ago, the platform saw its largest USD trading volume, with over $31.5 million worth of Bitcoin switching hands through it. What is more, a nationwide survey which was conducted among 1,000 online traders from the US and was held by eToro, showed that 43 percent of millennial online traders actually have more trust in cryptocurrency exchanges compared to the traditional US stock market. Moreover, 59 percent of all respondents who dont trade cryptocurrencies claimed that they would invest in it if it was offered by a trusted financial institution. Commenting on the matter was the managing director at eToro for the US market, Guy Hirsch, who said: Were seeing the beginning of a generational shift in trust from traditional stock exchanges to crypto exchanges. [] Younger investors experience with the stock market has seen a great deal of loss of trust, with the fall of Lehman Brothers because of irresponsible practices followed by the worst recession since the Great Depression. It also seems that technical data is revealing the potential formation of a new bull run which could take place this year, as Bitcoins 50-week moving average is dropping below the 100-week moving average for the very first time since April in 2015. While there have always been quite a lot of prominent figures speaking positively of Bitcoin, it looks like high-ranked executives and well-known individuals from traditional sectors are also turning bullish. Recently, the Vice President of Blockchain and Digital Currencies at IBM, Jesse Lund, said that he thinks bitcoin will hit $5,000 by the end of this year. He also outlined that he can see Bitcoin eventually worth over $1 million. He also explained that this is a number he likes because it would suggest that one satoshi will hit parity with the U.S. penny. Additionally, Twitters CEO Jack Dorsey, also CEO at Square, recently praised Bitcoins scaling solution  the Lightning Network and said that it is only a matter of time before it gets integrated into Squares CashApp. Whats more, even Elon Musk spoke about bitcoin, saying that its structure is brilliant.

However, early yesterday saw a different twist when bitcoins momentum suddenly waned and the most popular crypto fell back to a familiar territory: under the 4,000 USD mark, prompting its key counterparts to succumb to the pressure and falter as well. The weekends upbeat pace indicated a five-percent climb which, to many, is a decent enough figure considering the cryptos volatility and unease. Earlier this morning, it shed as much as 300USD per BTC to $3,800 on most crypto charts. Apparently, this is not something that bitcoin advocates want to see. For instance, majority of the leading cryptocurrencies caved in from the weekends heavy pull after enjoying a very short moment of advances. Moments before the start of todays session, the favorite crypto made a quick reversal and settled back in the red zone. Based on a CoinMarketCap update, BTC fell around 10 percent and was pegged at $3,807 from a mid-day peak of $4,200. The unexpected decline in the price of the worlds most popular digital currency translated to an estimated $5 billion in market cap that was lost in todays crypto trading, and nearly $15 billion overall from the rest of the globes virtual assets. Taking a quick peek at other crypto coins, etherium (ETH) continues to stay on top of the coins ranking, with a over $14 billion in market cap, according to data provided by CoinMarketCap. Ripple (XRP) comes in second, with around $12 billion in market cap. ETH rose almost 10 percent from the $126 mark it registered over the weekend, while XRP, which is trading at around $0.301, has shed around 8 percent in the past day. On the other hand, the ones being dragged down deeper are Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC), all having 10 percent declines as of this writing. Meanwhile, it is not yet clear as to what pushed many investors in the market today to let go of their digital assets. However, when prices do make an ascent, as they always do, and then dive in just a matter of hours in the past, it usually boils down to investors and traders profit-taking and inundating the market with an oversupply of virtual tokens.

Indeed, videos made by CryptoMining.farm investors showing the profits they have made on the platform abound on YouTube.
